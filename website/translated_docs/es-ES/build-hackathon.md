As one of our objectives in the Web3 Foundation is pushing the [Web3 technology stack](http://wiki.web3.foundation/en/latest/tech_stack/tech_stack_overview/), we would like to support any individual or team who wants to organize a hackathon that gets more developers to understand Polkadot/Substrate in your city.

We are not only providing technical resources for you, but we can have someone from our team give a hands-on workshop/presentation about the technology to help participants get started hacking on it more quickly.

## Ideas

- NFT
- Bonded Tokens
- New governance modules with different styles of voting & democracy
- Upgrade the TCR module
- IPFS integration
- Decentralized identity solutions
- Oracle module
- Implement Generalized State Channel/Plasma Chain
- Decentralized Exchange
- Tools for monitoring validator performance
- dApps across different parachains

## Why you should host a hackathon?

- Love to deliver the vision of Web3
- Learn the bleeding-edge technology
- Believe the Web3 technology stack is suitable for developers to build their applications
- Like to make connections

## How do hackathons differ from workshops?
Hackathon is aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and demonstrate their ideas to reality in a short period (few hours - one day). Workshops are more for getting developers familiar with the tooling and understanding more about what are the resources currently available and how they can make use of it.
