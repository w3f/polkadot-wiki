While Kusama has been its own network and has had its own ecosystem for a while now, it is still one big experiment and we need your participation for it to continue being a great success.

## Community

We want to foster a sense of collaboration amongst ourselves and the open source community. Kusma participants exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. We are here to collaborate, discuss, and even disagree. The key is doing this is a manner that comes from a place of respect and professionalism. Participants in the Kusama network may consist of participants in an online forum, on-chain governance participants, parachain deployment teams, validators, enthusiasts, and ecosystem tool builders. We expect for there to be participation from all backgrounds but like to set some social boundaries on how you may be treated and treat others.

Kusama 社区成员来自全球各地，不分种族、性别、或 背景。 社区参与者通过必要的资源阅读了解有关Kusama 的知识及其所有相关内容。这些知识使社区具备履行参与者职责时所需的必要信息。

## Bugs

Please understand that this network is, despite its success, an experiment with potential flaws, so it’s appreciated that community members help report any sort of exploits directly to the team before sharing publicly. Please see the [bug bounty program](kusama-bug-bounty).

## Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

请注意：这仅是几个示例，如果您有任何疑问，您总是可以咨询团队成员。

- Angry aggressive comments towards individuals or other projects on any medium of communication.
- Knowingly distributing false information about Kusama or other projects.
- Harassing other individuals or projects.

That said, please note that Kusama is an edgy and meme-friendly network and community member actions shouldn't be taken too seriously - try to assume jest before malice.

## What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact the administrator of the channel you’re in.

This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time. We are always willing to revise this document based on feedback from the Kusama participants and/or the Polkadot community.
