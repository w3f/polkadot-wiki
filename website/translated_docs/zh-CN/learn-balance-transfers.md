Balance transfers are used to send one balance from one account to another account. To start transferring balances, we will begin by using the Polkadot-JS User Interface.

## Polkadot-JS UI

Begin by opening up the [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). There are two ways to make a transaction: underneath "Accounts" by using the "Transfer" tab or through the "Accounts" tab. We will be starting off with the Accounts tab, so head there.

> Please note: For these examples, the network of choice is Polkadot. If you'd like to change this, please click on the network selection from the top left corner of the navigation.

Assuming that you've already [created a Polkadot or Kusama account](learn-account-generation), we will click on the "send" button beside the account you'd like to send from.

There should be a window that pops up displaying the sender, the receiver, the amount, and the existential deposit (minimum amount you must have in your account balance).

If you wanted to send a transfer using the "Transfer" tab underneath "Accounts", you'd need to head over to the specific tab and the window will ask you for the same information as before.
