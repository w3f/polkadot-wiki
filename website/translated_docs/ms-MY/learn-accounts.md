This document covers the basics of Polkadot and Kusama account addresses and how they exist on-chain. For a more in-depth explanation of the cryptography behind them, please see [the cryptography page](learn-cryptography).

## Address Format

The address format used in Substrate-based chains is SS58. SS58 is a modification of Base-58-check from Bitcoin with some minor modifications. Notably, the format contains an _address type_ prefix that identifies an address as belonging to a specific network.

For example:

- Polkadot addresses always start with the number 1.
- Kusama addresses always start with a capital letter like C, D, F, G, H, J...
- Generic Substrate addresses start with 5.

These prefixes are defined [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/External-Address-Format-(SS58)).

It's important to understand that the different formats for different networks are **merely different representations of the same public key in a private-public keypair** generated by an address generation tool. This makes the addresses compatible across Substrate-based chains as long as you convert the format.

> Many wallets allow you to convert between formats. Stand-alone tools exist as well, you can find them in the [address coversion tools](#address-conversion-tools) section.

## Address Generation, Derivation, and Portability

A valid account only requires a private key that can sign on one of the [supported curves and signature schemes](build-protocol-info#cryptography). Most wallets take many steps from a mnemonic phrase to account key, which affects the ability to use the same mnemonic phrase in multiple wallets. Wallets that use different steps will arrive at a different set of addresses from the same mnemonic.

### Seed Generation

Most wallets generate a mnemonic phrase for users to back up their wallets and generate a private key from the mnemonic. Not all wallets use the same algorithm to convert from mnemonic phrase to private key.

Subkey and Polkadot-JS based wallets use the BIP39 dictionary for mnemonic generation, but use the entropy byte array to generate the private key, while full BIP39 wallets (like Ledger) use 2048 rounds of PBKDF2 on the mnemonic. As such, the same mnemonic will not generate the same private keys. See [Substrate BIP39](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-bip39) for more information.

### Derivation Paths

Many Polkadot key generation tools support hard and soft derivation. See the [Subkey documentation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey) for details and examples of derivation path formats. The Polkadot-JS Apps and Extension as well as Parity Signer support custom derivation paths using the same syntax as Subkey.

Some wallets will automatically add derivation paths to the end of the generated mnemonic phrase. This will generate separate seeds for separate paths, which allows separate signing keys with the same mnemonic, e.g. `<mnemonic phrase>//polkadot` and `<mnemonic phrase>//kusama`. Although you may correctly save the mnemonic phrase, using it in another wallet will not generate the same addresses unless both wallets use the same derivation paths.

Polkadot and Kusama both have paths registered in the [BIP44 registry](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).

> **Warning:** You must have both the parent private key as well as the derivation path to arrive at the key for an address. Do not use custom derivation paths unless you are comfortable with your understanding of this topic.

### Portability

The above information brings us to portability: the ability to use a mnemonic phrase or seed across multiple wallets. Portability depends on a number of factors:

- Derivation path
- Mnemonic format
- Seed derivation
- Signature scheme

If you want to use the same mnemonic across multiple wallets, make sure that they follow compatible methods for generating keys and signing messages. If you cannot find understandable documentation, reach out to the project maintainers.

### For the Curious: How Prefixes Work

The [SS58 document](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/External-Address-Format-(SS58)) states that:

- Polkadot has an address type of `00000000b`, so `0` in decimal.
- Kusama (Polkadot Canary) has an address type of `00000010b`, so `2` in decimal.
- Generic Substrate has `00101010b` as address type, which is `42` in decimal.

Because Base58-check alphabet has no number 0, the lowest value is indeed 1. So `00000000b` is 1 in Base58-check. If we try to [decode](https://www.better-converter.com/Encoders-Decoders/Base58Check-to-Hexadecimal-Decoder) a Polkadot address like `1FRMM8PEiWXYax7rpS6X4XZX1aAAxSWx1CrKTyrVYhV24fg`, the result is `000aff6865635ae11013a83835c019d44ec3f865145943f487ae82a8e7bed3a66b29d7`. The first byte is `00`, which is indeed `00000000` in binary and `0` in decimal and thus matches the address type of Polkadot.

Let's take a look at Substrate addresses. If we decode `5CK8D1sKNwF473wbuBP6NuhQfPaWUetNsWUNAAzVwTfxqjfr`, we get `2a0aff6865635ae11013a83835c019d44ec3f865145943f487ae82a8e7bed3a66b77e5`. The first byte is `2a` which when [converted from hex to decimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html) is 42. 42 is `00101010` in binary, just as the SS58 document states.

Finally, let's look at Kusama addresses. Decoding `CpjsLDC1JFyrhm3ftC9Gs4QoyrkHKhZKtK7YqGTRFtTafgp` gives us `020aff6865635ae11013a83835c019d44ec3f865145943f487ae82a8e7bed3a66b0985` with the first byte being `02`, just as specified. If we try a Kusama address that starts with a completely different letter, like `J4iggBtsWsb61RemU2TDWDXTNHqHNfBSAkGvVZBtn1AJV1a`, we still get `02` as the first byte: `02f2d606a67f58fa0b3ad2b556195a0ef905676efd4e3ec62f8fa1b8461355f1142509`. It seems counterintuitive that some addresses always have the same prefix and others like Kusama can vary wildly, but it's just a quirk of Base58-check encoding.

## Obtaining and Managing an Address

The **most user-friendly** way to create a Polkadot or Kusama address is through the [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts). Remember to back up the seed phrase used to generate your account - the accounts are stored only in your browser, so purging the cache will wipe your accounts as well. You would then have to recreate them using the seed phrase given to you by the UI - this will also restore all your previously held balances.

A **more convenient and recommended** method of keeping the accounts stored on your computer is using the [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension). This extension remembers your accounts and allows you to clear your browser cache without fear. Still, don't forget to back up your seed phrase - if you lose access to this computer, or the extension somehow crashes beyond repair, the phrase will come in handy.

Please note that as this keeps your accounts in the browser, it is not a safe place to keep large holdings. By definition, a browser is a "hot wallet" and susceptible to a wide range of attacks, so keep your funds in cold storage when dealing with non-trivial amounts. For improved security, you can securely stash away the seed phrase for your accounts and remove all traces of the accounts from your computer after creating them.

Other than the extension and the default UI, Polkadot and Kusama addresses can also be created with the [Subkey tool](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/utils/subkey). Subkey is intended for users comfortable with using the command line and can seem intimidating, but is quite approachable. Follow the instructions in the [Subkey documentation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey). When used properly, Subkey is the **most secure** available method of creating an account.

There is also the very secure [Parity Signer](https://www.parity.io/signer/). This keeps your keys on an air-gapped mobile phone. However, it does require obtaining an old Android or iOS-compatible phone that you are comfortable using only for Parity Signer.

Hardware wallet integration is possible with Ledger. A full guide is available [here](learn-ledger).

Alternatively, you might find other wallets on the [Wallet](build-wallets) page, but bear in mind that some of these are **unaudited** and are not officially affiliated with Web3 Foundation or the Polkadot project unless otherwise stated.

## Balance Types

On Polkadot there are four different balance types that indicate whether your balance can be used for transfers, to pay fees, or must remain frozen and not used due to an on-chain requirement.

The balance types are defined by the `AccountData` struct in Substrate. The four types of balances include `free`, `reserved`, `misc_frozen` (`miscFrozen` in camel-case), and `fee_frozen` (`feeFrozen` in camel-case).

In general, the **usable** balance of the account is the amount that is `free` minus any funds that are considered frozen (either `misc_frozen` or `free_frozen`) and depends on the reason for which the funds are to be used. If the funds are to be used for transfers then the usable amount is the "free" amount minus any `misc_frozen` funds. However, if the funds are to be used to pay transaction fees than the usable amount would be the "free" funds minus any funds that are `fee_frozen`.

The "total" balance of the account is considered the amount of "free" funds in the account subtracted by any funds that are "reserved." Reserved funds are held due to on-chain requirements and can usually be freed by making some on-chain action. For example, the "Identity" pallet reserves funds while an on-chain identity is registered, but by clearing the identity you can unreserve the funds and make them free again.

## Existential Deposit and Reaping

When you generate an account (address), you only generate a _key_ that lets you access it. The account does not exist yet on-chain. For that, it needs the existential deposit: 0.001666666667 KSM (on Kusama) or 1 DOT (on Polkadot mainnet).

Having an account go below the existential deposit causes that account to be _reaped_. The account will be wiped from the blockchain's state to conserve space, along with any funds in that address. You do not lose access to the reaped address - as long as you have your private key or recovery phrase, you can still use the address - but it needs a top-up of another existential deposit to be able to interact with the chain.

Transaction fees cannot cause an account to be reaped. Since fees are deducted from the account before any other transaction logic, accounts with balances _equal to_ the existential deposit cannot construct a valid transaction. Additional funds will need to be added to cover the transaction fees.

Here's another way to think about existential deposits. Ever notice those `Thumbs.db` files on Windows or `.DS_Store` files on Mac? Those are junk, they serve no specific purpose other than making previews a bit faster. If a folder is completely empty save for such a file, you can remove the folder to clear junk off your hard drive. That does not mean you lose access to this folder forever - you can always recreate it. You have the _key_, after all - you're the computer's owner. It just means you want to keep your computer clean until you maybe end up needing this folder again, and then recreate it. Your address is like this folder - it gets removed from the chain when nothing is in it, but gets put back when it has at least the existential deposit.

## Indices

A Kusama or Polkadot address can have an index. An index is like a short and easy to remember version of an address. Claiming an index requires a deposit which is released when the index is cleared.

Indices are populated in order. Think of them like slots going from 0 to any arbitrary number:

`[0][1][2][3][4][5][6]...`

If slots 0-2 are populated by addresses A, B and C respectively, and I add an existential deposit to address X, that address will automatically be put into slot 3. Henceforth, you can send me money by just sending to `[3]` rather than remembering my whole address.

```js
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6]...
[A][B][C][X][ ][ ][ ]...
```

But what if an account gets reaped as explained above? In that case, the index is emptied. In other words, the slot frees up again. If someone creates a new account, they may end up using the same index another address was using before.

It is possible to _freeze_ an index and permanently assign it to an address. This action consumes a deposit but makes sure that the index can never be reclaimed unless released by the holding account.

To register an index, submit a `claim` extrinsic to the `indices` pallet, and follow up with a `freeze` extrinsic. The easiest way to do this is via PolkadotJS UI through the _Developer -> Extrinsics_ menu:

![Indices extrinsics](assets/accounts/index.png)

To find available indices to claim, [this helper tool may come in handy](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/indices/).

## Identities

The [_Identities pallet_](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/identity) built into Polkadot allows users to attach on-chain metadata to their accounts. This metadata can be verified by independent registrars to provide trustworthiness. To learn more about how to set or release an identity, how to define sub-accounts, or how to become a registrar, please read [this guide](learn-identity).

## Proxy Accounts

Polkadot comes with a generalized proxy account system that allows users to keep keys in cold storage while proxies act on their behalf with restricted (or unrestricted) functionality. See the [proxies](learn-proxies) page for more information.

## Multi-signature Accounts

It is possible to create a multi-signature account in Substrate-based chains. A multi-signature account is composed of one or more addresses and a threshold. The threshold defines how many signatories (participating addresses) need to agree on the submission of an extrinsic in order for the call to be successful.

For example, Alice, Bob, and Charlie set up a multi-sig with a threshold of 2. This means Alice and Bob can execute any call even if Charlie disagrees with it. Likewise, Charlie and Bob can execute any call without Alice. A threshold is typically a number smaller than the total number of members but can also be equal to it, which means they all have to be in agreement.

> Learn more about multisig accounts from our [technical explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJLqszvhMyM&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8&index=25&ab_channel=Polkadot).

Multi-signature accounts have several uses:

- securing your own stash: use additional signatories as a 2FA mechanism to secure your funds. One signer can be on one computer, another can be on another, or in cold storage. This slows down your interactions with the chain, but is orders of magnitude more secure.
- board decisions: legal entities such as businesses and foundations use multi-sigs to collectively govern over the entity's treasury.
- group participation in governance: a multi-sig account can do everything a regular account can. A multi-sig account could be a council member in Kusama's governance, where a set of community members could vote as one entity.

Multi-signature accounts **cannot be modified after being created**. Changing the set of members or altering the threshold is not possible and instead requires the dissolution of the current multi-sig and creation of a new one. As such, multi-sig account addresses are **deterministic**, i.e. you can always calculate the address of a multi-sig just by knowing the members and the threshold, without the account existing yet. This means one can send tokens to an address that does not exist yet, and if the entities designated as the recipients come together in a new multi-sig under a matching threshold, they will immediately have access to these tokens.

### Generating Addresses of Multi-signature Accounts

> NOTE: Addresses that are provided to the multi-sig wallets must be sorted. The below methods for generating sort the accounts for you, but if you are implementing your own sorting then be aware that the public keys are compared byte-for-byte and sorted ascending before being inserted in the payload that is hashed.

Addresses are deterministically generated from the signers and threshold of the multisig wallet. For a code example (in TypeScript) of generating you can view the internals of `@w3f/msig-util` [here](https://github.com/lsaether/msig-util/blob/master/src/actions/deriveAddress.ts).

The `@w3f/msig-util` is a small CLI tool that can determine the multisignature address based on your inputs.

```zsh
$ npx @w3f/msig-util@1.0.7 derive --addresses 15o5762QE4UPrUaYcM83HERK7Wzbmgcsxa93NJjkHGH1unvr,1TMxLj56NtRg3scE7rRo8H9GZJMFXdsJk1GyxCuTRAxTTzU --threshold 1
npx: installed 79 in 7.764s
--------------------------------
Addresses: 15o5762QE4UPrUaYcM83HERK7Wzbmgcsxa93NJjkHGH1unvr 1TMxLj56NtRg3scE7rRo8H9GZJMFXdsJk1GyxCuTRAxTTzU
Threshold: 1
Multisig Address (SS58: 0): 15FKUKXC6kwaXxJ1tXNywmFy4ZY6FoDFCnU3fMbibFdeqwGw
--------------------------------
```

The Polkadot-JS Apps UI also supports multi-sig accounts, as documented in the [Account Generation page](learn-account-generation#multi-signature-accounts). This is easier than generating them manually.

### Making Transactions with a Multi-signature Account

There are three types of actions you can take with a multi-sig account:

- Executing a call.
- Approving a call.
- Cancelling a call.

In scenarios where only a single approval is needed, a convenience method `as_multi_threshold_1` should be used. This function takes only the other signatories and the raw call as its arguments.

However, in anything but the simple one approval case, you will likely need more than one of the signatories to approve the call before finally executing it. When you create a new call or approve a call as a multi-sig, you will need to place a small deposit. The deposit stays locked in the pallet until the call is executed. The reason for the deposit is to place an economic cost on the storage space that the multi-sig call takes up on the chain and discourage users from creating dangling multi-sig operations that never get executed. The deposit will be reserved in the caller's accounts so participants in multi-signature wallets should have spare funds available.

The deposit is dependent on the `threshold` parameter and is calculated as follows:

```
Deposit = DepositBase + threshold * DepositFactor
```

Where `DepositBase` and `DepositFactor` are chain constants set in the runtime code.

Currently, the DepositBase is equal to `deposit(1, 88)` (key size is 32; value is size 4+4+16+32 = 56 bytes) and the DepositFactor is equal to `deposit(0,32)` (additional address of 32 bytes).

The deposit function in JavaScript is defined below, cribbed from the [Rust source](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/polkadot/src/constants.rs#L26).

```js
// Polkadot
const DOLLARS = 10000000000; // planck
const MILLICENTS = 100000; // planck

// Kusama
// const DOLLARS = 166666666666.67;
// const MILLICENTS = 1666666.66;

const deposit = (items, bytes) => {
  return items * 20 * DOLLARS + bytes * 100 * MILLICENTS;
};

console.log("DepositBase", deposit(1, 88));
console.log("DepositFactor", deposit(0, 32));
```

Thus the deposit values can be calculated as shown in the table below.

|               | Polkadot (DOT) | Kusama (KSM)   | Polkadot (planck) | Kusama (planck) |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| DepositBase   | 20.088         | 3.347999999942 | 200880000000      | 3347999999942   |
| DepositFactor | .032           | 0.005333333312 | 320000000         | 5333333312      |

Let's consider an example of a multi-sig on Polkadot with a threshold of 2 and 3 signers: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. First, Alice will create the call on chain by calling `as_multi` with the raw call. When doing this Alice will have to deposit `DepositBase + (2 * DepositFactor) = 20.152 DOT` while she waits for either Bob or Charlie to also approve the call. When Bob comes to approve the call and execute the transaction, he will not need to place the deposit and Alice will receive her deposit back.

### Example with Polkadot.JS

For this example, we will be using the [Westend](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-networks#westend-test-network) testnet and [Polkadot.JS Apps](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-balance-transfers#polkadot-js-apps) to create a 2-of-3 multisig address and send a transaction with it.

> While Westend is meant to replicate the Polkadot mainnet as closely as possible, there are a few notable differences:
> 
> - Existential deposit is equal to 0.01 WND (Westies; Westend's native coin) instead of 1 DOT.
> - The multisignature transaction deposit is equal to ~1 WND instead of ~20.2 DOT.
> 
> The photos below reflects values in WND, but instructions are the same for DOT.

**To create a multisig address and send a transaction using it, you will need the following:**

- List of the multisig member's addresses. We will use Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
- DOT to deposit into the multisig address.
- ~20.2 DOT refundable deposit to send a multisig tarnsaction. This needs to be in the address that initiates a multisignature transaction (in this example, Alice).

You should already have your own account with some coins in it.

![Account page](assets/accounts/multisig-addy.png)

To generate the multisig address, we need to **add the multisig member addresses to the contact book** under "Accounts > Address book".

![Address book](assets/accounts/multisig-1.png)

For each address, click "Add contact" in the upper right and provide the address and a name.

![Add Contact](assets/accounts/multisig-2.png)

Here, Bob and Charlie have been added.

![Address books 2](assets/accounts/multisig-3.png)

**Next, we need to create the new multisignature address.** Navitage to the Accounts page (from the toolbar, "Accounts > Accounts") and click the "+ Multisig" button. We will supply the three multisig member addresses, with a value '2' for the threshold.

![New multisig](assets/accounts/multisig-4.png)

Click 'Create', and you should see the new multisig address appear on this Accounts page.

![5](assets/accounts/multisig-5.png)

**Let's fund the address now.** For this example, we will transfer some coins from Alice's account to the multisig address. Under Alice's address, click 'Send', select the multisig wallet as the destination, and provide an amount. Then, click 'Make Transfer', and then 'Sign and Submit'.

![6](assets/accounts/multisig-6.png) ![7](assets/accounts/multisig-7.png)

We can see that the multisig account now has a balance.

![9](assets/accounts/multisig-9.png)

**To send a transaction, we need one of the members to initiate it.** Let's use Alice to initiate the transaction.

Make sure Alice has enough coins to cover the multisig transaction deposit and the transaction fees. Then, click 'Send' under the "Multisig Test Address", select a destination address (we generated an address locally) and a transfer amount, and click 'Make Transfer'.

![10](assets/accounts/multisig-10.png)

To sign as Alice, make sure she is selected as the 'multisig signatory', click 'Sign and Submit', and sign the transaction.

![11](assets/accounts/multisig-11.png)

You will now see a pending transaction the 'Multisig Test Address' (the red '1' icon), and if you click the dropdown under Alice's balance, you will see that a value equivalent to the multisig deposit has been 'reserved', rendering that value untransferable until the multisig transaction completes.

![12](assets/accounts/multisig-12.png)

**Next, we need a second signature.** Let's get it from Bob. In Bob's browser, repeat the following from the above steps.

1. Add Alice, Charlie, and the multisig transaction destination addresses to Bob's Address book.
2. Create a new multisig address with the same parameters (Bob, Alice, and Charlie's addresses, and a threshold value of '2').

> NOTE: Since multisig address genereation is deterministic, if Bob (or any other member), on his computer, were to generate a multisig address using Alice's, Charlie's and his addresses, with a threshold value of '2', he would produce the **same** multisig address that Alice has here.

If done correctly, we should see that the **same** multisig address is produced in Bob's browser, and that a pending transaction is displayed, too.

![13](assets/accounts/multisig-13.png)

Next, to get Bob's signature, he needs to craft the same multisig transaction that Alice did by providing the same destination address and transfer amount (together, transaction parameters), signing, and submitting it. Alice initiated the transaction by uploading a signature of the hash of the transaction and the hash. These transaction parameters will allow Bob to produce and sign the same transaction (the same hash) that Alice signed earlier.

![14](assets/accounts/multisig-14.png)

Click 'Make Transfer', ensure that Bob is the 'multisig signatory', and click 'Sign and Submit'. Note that 'Multisig message with call (for final approval)' is automatically enabled; this means that, since the transaction will reached the signature threshold, it will execute the actual transaction on chain after adding the second signature.

![15](assets/accounts/multisig-15.png)

Assuming no errors, 'Multisig Destination Account' has a balance of 0.3 WND, and Alice's account has released the multisig transaction deposit.
