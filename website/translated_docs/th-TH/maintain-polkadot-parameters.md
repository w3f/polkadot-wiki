Many of these parameter values can be updated via on-chain governance. If you require absolute certainty as to their values, it is recommended you directly check the constants by looking at the [chain state](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/constants) and/or [storage](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate).

### Periods of common actions and attributes

_NOTE: Kusama runs 4x as fast as Polkadot, except Polkadot also has 6 second blocktimes. See [Kusama Parameters](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/kusama-parameters) for more details on how Kusama's parameters differ from Polkadot's._

- Slot: 6 seconds \*(generally one block per slot, although see note below)
- Epoch: 4 hours (2,400 slots x 6 seconds)
- Session: 4 hours (Session and Epoch lengths are the same)
- Era: 24 hours (6 sessions per Era, 2,400 slots x 6 epochs x 6 seconds)

| Polkadot | Time      | Slots\* |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Slot     | 6 seconds | 1         |
| Epoch    | 4 hours   | 2,400     |
| Session  | 4 hours   | 2,400     |
| Era      | 24 hours  | 14,400    |

\*_A maximum of one block per slot can be in a canonical chain. However, occasionally a slot will be without a block in the chain. Thus, the times given are estimates. See [Consensus](learn-consensus) for more details._

### Precision

DOT have 10 decimals of precision. In other words, 10 \*\* 10 (10,000,000,000 or ten billion) Plancks make up a DOT.

The denomination of DOT was changed from 12 decimals of precision at block #1,248,328 in an event known as _Denomination Day_. See [Redenomination](redenomination) for details.
