## Polkadot Wallets

The integration of a [wallet](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary#wallet) with Polkadot allows for simple and easy access to private keys and signing transactions. Below are some wallets that support Polkadot along with their development statuses.

Note that inclusion does not necessarily imply endorsement of that wallet. Polkadot support can provide assistance with issues related to Polkadot-JS, the Polkadot{.js} extension, or Parity Signer. For other wallet software, you should contact the developers of that wallet.

## Encryption Enhancement

Some recently generated `JSON` account files cannot be imported (restored) into older wallet software. This is due to an enhanced encryption method, which is also noticeable in a slight delay when encrypting/decrypting your wallet. If you are unable to load a `JSON` file, please ensure that you are using the latest version of the wallet software. If you are still unable to load it, ensure that the wallet software is using the latest version of the [Polkadot API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/).
