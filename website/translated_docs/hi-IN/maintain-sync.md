If you're building dapps or products on a Substrate-based chain like Polkadot, Kusama or a custom Substrate implementation, you probably want the ability to run a node-as-a-back-end. After all, it's always better to rely on your own infrastructure than on a third-party-hosted one in this brave new decentralized world.

This guide will show you how to connect to [Kusama network](https://kusama.network), but the same process applies to any other [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/)-based chain. First, let's clarify the term _full node_.

### Types of Nodes

A blockchain's growth comes from a _genesis block_, _extrinsics_, and _events_.

When a validator seals block 1, it takes the blockchain's state at block 0. It then applies all pending changes on top of it, and emits the events that are the result of these changes. Later, the state of the chain at block 1 is used in the same way to build the state of the chain at block 2, and so on. Once two thirds of the validators agree on a specific block being valid, it is finalized.

An **archive node** keeps all the past blocks. An archive node makes it convenient to query the past state of the chain at any point in time. Finding out what an account's balance at a certain block was, or which extrinsics resulted in a certain state change are fast operations when using an archive node. However, an archive node takes up a lot of disk space - around Kusama's 1.6 millionth block this was around 15 to 20GB.

A **full node** is _pruned_, meaning it discards all information older than 256 blocks, but keeps the extrinsics for all past blocks, and the genesis block. A node that is pruned this way requires much less space than an archive node. In order to query past state through a full node, a user would have to wait for the node to rebuild the chain up until that block. A full node _can_ rebuild the entire chain with no additional input from other nodes and become an archive node. One caveat is that if finality stalled for some reason and the last finalized block is more than 256 blocks behind, a pruned full node will not be able to sync to the network.

Archive nodes are used by utilities that need past information - like block explorers, council scanners, discussion platforms like [Polkassembly](https://polkassembly.io), and others. They need to be able to look at past on-chain data. Full nodes are used by everyone else - they allow you to read the current state of the chain and to submit transactions directly to the chain without relying on a centralized infrastructure provider.

Another type of node is a **light node**. A light node has only the runtime and the current state, but does not store past extrinsics and so cannot restore the full chain from genesis. Light nodes are useful for resource restricted devices. An interesting use-case of light nodes is a Chrome extension, which is a node in its own right, running the runtime in WASM format: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-light-ui

### Fast Install Instructions (Windows)

> This works only on Windows Pro with virtualization enabled.

> Not recommended if you're a validator. Please see [secure validator setup](maintain-guides-secure-validator)

- Install WSL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
- Install Ubuntu (same webpage): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
- Determine the latest version of the Polkadot binary (you can see the latest releases here: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases)
- Download the correct Polkadot binary within Ubuntu by running the following command. Replace `*VERSION*` with the tag of the latest version from the last step (e.g. `v0.8.22`): `curl -sL https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/*VERSION*/polkadot -o polkadot`
- Run the following: `sudo chmod +x polkadot`
- Run the following: `./polkadot --name "Your Node Name Here"`
- Find your node at https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Kusama

### Fast Install Instructions (Linux)

> Not recommended if you're a validator. Please see [secure validator setup](maintain-guides-secure-validator)

For the most recent binary please see the [release page](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/) on the polkadot repository. The URL in the code snippet below may become slightly out-of-date.

Also please note that the nature of pre-built binaries means that they may not work on your particular architecture or Linux distribution. If you see an error like `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error` it likely means the binary is not compatible with your system. You will either need to compile the [source code yourself](#clone-and-build) or use [docker](#using-docker).

- Determine the latest version of the Polkadot binary (you can see the latest releases here: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases)
- Download the correct Polkadot binary within Ubuntu by running the following command. Replace `*VERSION*` with the tag of the latest version from the last step (e.g. `v0.8.22`): `curl -sL https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/*VERSION*/polkadot -o polkadot`
- Run the following: `sudo chmod +x polkadot`
- Run the following: `./polkadot --name "Your Node Name Here"`
- Find your node at https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Kusama

## Get Substrate

Follow instructions as outlined [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started) - note that Windows users will have their work cut out for them. It's better to use a virtual machine instead.

Test if the installation was successful by running `cargo --version`.

```bash
Î» cargo --version
cargo 1.41.0 (626f0f40e 2019-12-03)
```

## Clone and Build

The [paritytech/polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) repo's master branch contains the latest Kusama code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot kusama
cd kusama
./scripts/init.sh
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, if you wish to use a specific release, you can check out a specific tag (`v0.8.3` in the example below):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot kusama
cd kusama
git checkout tags/v0.8.3
./scripts/init.sh
cargo build --release
```

## Run

The built binary will be in the `target/release` folder, called `polkadot`.

```bash
./target/release/polkadot --name "My node's name"
```

Use the `--help` flag to find out which flags you can use when running the node. For example, if [connecting to your node remotely](maintain-wss), you'll probably want to use `--ws-external` and `--rpc-cors all`.

The syncing process will take a while depending on your bandwidth, processing power, disk speed and RAM. On a \$10 DigitalOcean droplet, the process can complete in some 36 hours.

Congratulations, you're now syncing with Kusama. Keep in mind that the process is identical when using any other Substrate chain.

## Running an Archive Node

When running as a simple sync node (above), only the state of the past 256 blocks will be kept. When validating, it defaults to [archive mode](#types-of-nodes). To keep the full state use the `--pruning` flag:

```bash
./target/release/polkadot --name "My node's name" --pruning archive
```

It is possible to almost quadruple synchronization speed by using an additional flag: `--wasm-execution Compiled`. Note that this uses much more CPU and RAM, so it should be turned off after the node is in sync.

## Using Docker

Finally, you can use Docker to run your node in a container. Doing this is a bit more advanced so it's best left up to those that either already have familiarity with docker, or have completed the other set-up instructions in this guide. If you would like to connect to your node's WebSockets ensure that you run you node with the `--rpc-external` and `--ws-external` commands.

```zsh
docker run -p 9944:9944 parity/polkadot:v0.8.24 --name "calling_home_from_a_docker_container" --rpc-external --ws-external
```
