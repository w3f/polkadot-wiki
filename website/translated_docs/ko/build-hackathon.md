As one of our objectives in the Web3 Foundation is promoting the [Web3 technology stack](http://wiki.web3.foundation/en/latest/tech_stack/tech_stack_overview/), we would like to support any individual or team who wants to organize a hackathon that gets more developers to understand Polkadot and Substrate in your city or online.

We are not only providing technical resources for you, but we can have someone from our team give a hands-on workshop/presentation about the technology to help participants get started hacking on it more quickly.

## Ideas

- NFT
- Bonded Tokens
- New governance pallets with different styles of voting & democracy
- Upgrade the TCR pallet
- IPFS integration
- 분산화된 신원 인증 솔루션 (Decentralized identity solutions)
- Oracle pallet
- 제네럴 스테이트 체널/플라즈마 체인의 구현 (Implement Generalized State Channel/Plasma Chain)
- DeX (Decentralized Exchange)
- 밸리데이터 퍼포먼스 모니터링 툴 (Tools for monitoring validator performance)
- dApps across different parachains

## 왜 해커톤을 해야만 할까요?

- Web3의 비전을 전달하는 것을 사랑하기 때문에
- 최신 기술을 배우기 위해서
- 개발자들이 어플리케이션을 만들기 위해 Web3 기술 스택이 알맞다는 것을 믿으니까
- 사람들과 만나는 것을 좋아하니까

## 워크샵과 해커톤은 어떻게 다른가요?

Hackathon is aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and demonstrate their ideas to reality in a short period (few hours - one day). Workshops are more for getting developers familiar with the tooling and understanding more about what are the resources currently available and how they can make use of it.

## 어떻게 당신의 도시에서 해커톤을 열 수 있나요?

1. 해커톤 지원서를 제출합니다  (Coming soon.)
2. 리뷰하고
3. 결정한 뒤
4. 진행합니다.

## 어떻게 당신을 도와드릴 수 있을까요?

- 기술적인 리소스나 자료들을 제공하고.
- 장소를 찾아보고.
- 원활한 해커톤 진행을 할 수 있도록 합니다.

## Upcoming Hackathons
