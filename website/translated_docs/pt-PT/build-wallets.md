## Polkadot Wallets

The integration of a [wallet](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary#wallet) with Polkadot allows for simple and easy access to private keys and signing transactions. Below are some wallets that support Polkadot along with their development statuses. Note that inclusion does not necessarily imply endorsement of that wallet.

## Encryption Enhancement

Wallets (JSON files) recently generated by the polkadot.js web app (or other applications which use the latest version of the Polkadot JS API) currently cannot be imported (restored) into some wallets, including the polkadot.js extension. This is due to an enhanced encryption method, which is also noticeable in a slight delay when encrypting/decrypting your wallet. The next version of the polkadot.js extension, which will be released soon, will support this new encryption. Other wallet software will also need to update to use the latest version of the Polkadot JS API before they will be able to use these wallets.

If you are unable to load a JSON file in a wallet, try loading it in the Polkadot-JS web application.
