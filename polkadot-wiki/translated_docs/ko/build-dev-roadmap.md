Developers need some guide posts for when they can expect certain milestones to be reached by the upstream teams. We will try to keep the sections below up to date with the what we know and add definite dates if possible.

## Substrate

- [1.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/v1.0) - The Substrate 1.0.0 stable release is the recommended way to get started developing on Substrate.
- [2.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) - The master branch of Substrate is currently where development is happening for the next release of Substrate.

## Polkadot

### Current Testnet

- [Alexander Testnet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot#install-poc-4-on-alexander-testnet) - The Polkadot Alexander testnet is the PoC-4 release of the Polkadot source code.

### Kusama

[Kusama Canary Network](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot#22-install-kusama-canary-network) is a live network aimed to test the economic conditions of Polkadot.

- It is currently in the PoA phase, meaning that transfers and most functionality besides signalling the intention to stake have been disabled.

## Cumulus

Cumulus is currently under development, with an estimated release to be sometime in October.

## ink!

Ink! is currently under development, however it is usable today by the brave developer. It's estimated that it will become more stabilized over the next few months.
