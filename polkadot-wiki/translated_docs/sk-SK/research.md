The Polkadot [research pages](https://research.polkadot.network) are edited directly by the researchers at W3F and contain papers, articles and documents that are sources for the information on the wiki.

The following papers and articles may be of special interest for those interested in investigating Polkadot from a research or academic perspective.

## Research Papers
