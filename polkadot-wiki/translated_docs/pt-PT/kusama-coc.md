Kusama is an entirely new network, it’s one big experiment and we need your participation for it to be a great success.

A Kusama community member is expected to keep the utmost respect for others. We want to foster a sense of collaboration amongst ourselves and the open source community. Kusma participants exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. We are here to collaborate, discuss, and even disagree. The key is doing this is a manner that comes from a place of respect and professionalism. Participants in the Kusama network may consist of participants in an online forum, on-chain governance participants, parachain deployment teams, validators, enthusiasts, and ecosystem tool builders. We expect for there to be participation from all backgrounds but like to set some social boundaries on how you may be treated and treat others.
