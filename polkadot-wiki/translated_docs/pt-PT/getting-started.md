Getting started on Polkadot is easy! The wiki already contains guides for doing most of the core functionality. Our wiki has three main sections: Learn (for learners), Build (for people that want to build on Polkadot), and Maintain (for people that want to maintain the network).

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to familiarizing yourself with crytography, blockchain concepts, decentralization, networks, crytocurrency, and so much more. This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and is also a free course.

For brand-new learners of Polkadot:

- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos][teched videos]: These are great introductory videos that explain and demonstrate how to use Polkadot and its [User Interface][ui].
- Reading [What is Polkadot? A Brief Introduction][article] on Medium. There are also other great articles to read on [Polkadot's Medium][p medium] or [Web3 Foundation's Medium][w medium].
- [Creating a Polkadot Account][account generation]
- [Sending a Transaction][transaction]
- [Staking as Nominator][nominator]
- [Running a Validator][validator]
- [Setting an Identity][identity]
- [Creating a Proxy Account][proxy]
- [Making Proposals and Voting for Referenda][democracy]
- Social Recovery (Coming soon!)
- [Running for the Council][council]
- [Voting for Councillors][council voting]
