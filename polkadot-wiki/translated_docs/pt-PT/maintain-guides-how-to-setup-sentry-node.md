title: Set Up a Sentry Node - Public Node
sidebar_label: Set Up a Sentry Node
---

This guide assumes you have already set up a validator and would like to make it more resilient and protect against sybil attack or DDoS. It has same configuration of the [polkadot secure validator](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-secure-validator).

In this guide, we will walk you through how to configure a validator that sits inside a VPN. The validator only talks to the public facing nodes to isolate it from the internet and reduce the chance of your validator being hacked.

## VPN Installation & Configuration

We will use Wireguard to configure the VPN. Wireguard is a fast and secure VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography. If you want to learn more about Wireguard, please go [here](https://www.wireguard.com/). Before we move on to the next step, configure the firewall to open the required ports.

```bash
# ssh port
ufw allow 22/tcp
# wireguard port
ufw allow 51820/udp
# libp2p port (Note: Only public node is required))
ufw allow 30333/tcp
ufw enable
# double check the firewall rules
ufw verbose
```

### 1. Install Wireguard

```bash
# install linux headers
apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
apt-get update # you can skip this on Ubuntu 18.04
apt-get install wireguard
```

### 2. Generating Keys

There are two commands you will use quite a bit when setting up Wireguard; `wg` is the configuration utility for managing Wireguard tunnel interfaces; `wg-quick` is a utility for starting and stopping the interface.

To generate the public / private keypair, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd /etc/wireguard
umask 077
wg genkey | sudo tee privatekey | wg pubkey | sudo tee publickey
```

You will see that two files, `publickey` and `privatekey`, have been created. As may be guessed from their names, `publickey` contains the public key and `privatekey` contains the private key of the keypair.

### 3. Configuration

Now create a `wg0.conf` file under the `/etc/wireguard/` directory. This file will be used to configure the interface.

Here is a `wg0.conf` configuration template for the **validator**.

```bash
[Interface]
# specify the address you want to assign for this machine.
Address = 10.0.0.1/32
# the private key you just generated
PrivateKey = 8MeWtQjBrmYazzwni7s/9Ow37U8eECAfAs0AIuffFng=
# listening port of your server
ListenPort = 51820
# if you use wg to add a new peer when running, it will automatically
# save the newly added peers to your configuration file
# without requiring a restart
SaveConfig = true

# Public Node A
[Peer]
# replace it to the public node A public key
PublicKey = Vdepw3JhRKDytCwjwA0nePLFiNsfB4KxGewl4YwAFRg=
# public ip address for your public node machine
Endpoint = 112.223.334.445:51820
# replace it to the public node A interface address
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
# keep the connection alive by sending a handshake every 21 seconds
PersistentKeepalive = 21
```

> Note: In this guide, we only set up 1 peer (public node)

You need to do the previous steps (1 and 2) again in your **public node** but the `wg0.conf` configuration file will look like this:

```bash
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
PrivateKey = eCii0j3IWi4w0hScc8myUj5QjXjjt5rp1VVuqlEmM24=
ListenPort = 51820
SaveConfig = true

# Validator
[Peer]
# replace this with the validator public key
PublicKey = iZeq+jm4baF3pTWR1K1YEyLPhrfpIckGjY/DfwCoKns=
# public ip address of the validator
Endpoint = 55.321.234.4:51820
# replace it with the validator interface address
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
PersistentKeepalive = 21
```

### 4. Test-Connection

If everything goes well, you are ready to test the connection.

To start the tunnel interface, execute the following command in both your `validator` and `public node`.

```bash
wg-quick up wg0

# The console would output something like this
#[#] ip link add wg0 type wireguard
#[#] wg setconf wg0 /dev/fd/63
#[#] ip -4 address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev wg0
#[#] ip link set mtu 1420 up dev wg0
```

> Note: If you are not able to start Wireguard or getting any errors during start, restart the computer and run the above command again.

You can check the status of the interface by running `wg` :

```bash
# Output
 interface: wg0
  public key: iZeq+jm4baF3pTWR1K1YEyLPhrfpIckGjY/DfwCoKns=
  private key: (hidden)
  listening port: 51820

peer: Vdepw3JhRKDytCwjwA0nePLFiNsfB4KxGewl4YwAFRg=
  endpoint: 112.223.334.445:51820
  allowed ips: 10.0.0.2/32
  latest handshake: 18 seconds ago
  transfer: 580 B received, 460 B sent
  persistent keepalive: every 25 seconds
```

You can then use `ping` to verify the connectivity between the nodes.

In case you want to update `wg0.conf`, run `wg-quick down wg0` to stop the interface first.

### 5. Configuring your Sentry Node and Validator

After you have started the `wg0` interface on your public node and validator, do spend a little bit of time to take a look at the following description of those flags you are going to use.

`--sentry <VALIDATOR_MULTIADDR>` - This would be required for your public node to be an authority as an observer. That means it acts the same as a validator node but without holding keys or signing. The difference between running a full node versus adding an extra `--sentry` flag is that a full node might not have all the data the validator needs to validate properly, while a sentry node will prioritize consensus messages to the validator. `--sentry` implies `--reserved-nodes`.

`--sentry-nodes <SENTRY_MULTIADDR>` - This is required for your validator node to specify the sentry nodes to connect to. This flag will ensure that the isolated validator node can only be reached through it's sentry nodes. `--sentry-nodes` also implies `--reserved-nodes`.

`--reserved-nodes` - The node will try to connect to these nodes and always accept connections from them, but it will still connect and accept connections from other nodes as well. This is useful if you want to have multiple validator nodes specify each other as peers.

`--reserved-only` - Only allows the connection from reserved nodes you defined.

#### P2P Networking

Nodes will use [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) as the networking layer to establish peers and gossip messages. In order to specify nodes as peers, you must do so using a `multiaddress` (`multiaddr`), which includes a node's `Peer Identity` (`PeerId`). A validator node will need to specify the `multiaddr` of it's sentry node(s), and a sentry node will specify the `multiaddr` of it's validator node(s).

##### Multiaddr

`multiaddr` - A `multiaddr` is a flexible encoding of multiple layers of protocols into a human readable addressing scheme. For example, `/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/1234` is a valid `multiaddr` that specifies you want to reach the 127.0.0.1 IPv4 loopback address with UDP packets on port 1234. Addresses in Substrate based chains will often take the form:

```
/ip4/<IP ADDRESS>/tcp/<P2P PORT>/p2p/<PEER IDENTITY>
```

- `IP_ADDRESS` - Unless the node is public, this will often be the ip address of the node within the private network.

- `P2P_PORT` - This is the port that nodes will send p2p messages over. By default, this will be 30333, but can be explicitly specified using the `--port <P2P_PORT>` cli flag.

- `PEER IDENTITY` - The PeerId is a unique identifier for each peer.

##### PeerId

Each peer in the network will have a private (secret) key (not to be confused with account keys or session keys) that will be used for network messaging. The secret key will have a corresponding public key, as well as a public address (`PeerId`) derived from this private key. `PeerId`' is derived from the secret key that is stored in the following directory by default:

```
/home/$USER/.local/share/polkadot/chains/<CHAIN>/network/secret_ed25519
```

Where `<CHAIN>` will be either `polkadot` for Polkadot, `ksmcc3` for Kusama, or `westend2` for Westend.

If the `secret_ed25519` file does not exist by the time the node is running (or is not otherwise specified), a new `secret_ed25519` will be created and used to derive a new `PeerId`.

If you want to explicitly specify the secret key to use, you can do so with the `--node-key-file <KEY_FILE>` flag, where `KEY_FILE` is the path of a file containing an unencoded 32 byte Ed25519 secret key, or the `--node-key <KEY>` flag, where `KEY` is a hex-encoded 32 byte secret key. If explicitly specifying a secret key, it is recommended to specify it as a file.

> Note: It is useful to generate or back up the `secret_ed25519` files if you want to use static addresses for sentry configurations. Otherwise you may have to dynamically find and set the `PeerId`.

You can use [subkey](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/utils/subkey) to generate a new `secret_ed25519` as follows:

```bash
> subkey generate-node-key </PATH/SECRET_ED25519_FILE>
# Output
12D3KooWSAhdYsqrJKed3r5HKTJzpEWFUXCFmn6wv85M2woLLJpD
```

Running this will return the corresponding `PeerId` for the `secret_ed25519`.

> Note: You may see two different kinds of representations of `PeerId`s, one that looks like `12D3KooWSAhdYsqrJKed3r5HKTJzpEWFUXCFmn6wv85M2woLLJpD`, and one that looks like `QmdtiSGnqDoHrfVyxrRWuETyehMnmZJhxrnVBFyYtY7Trk`. These are two different representations of the same `secret_ed25519` key and will both work, however `Qm...` is the legacy representation. It is recommended to use the updated representation (`1D3KooW...`), otherwise warnings may be shown in the logs.

##### Retrieving `PeerId`'s

There are a couple of way to find out the `PeerId`. of the validator and sentry nodes.

You can use `subkey` to print out the corresponding `PeerId` using:

```bash
subkey inspect-node-key </PATH/SECRET_ED25519_FILE>
# Output
12D3KooWSAhdYsqrJKed3r5HKTJzpEWFUXCFmn6wv85M2woLLJpD
```

Another way is by starting the node to see the identity printed as follows:

`./polkadot --validator`

Here we can see our `PeerId` is `12D3KooWSAhdYsqrJKed3r5HKTJzpEWFUXCFmn6wv85M2woLLJpD`.

Lastly, we can also find the `PeerId` by calling the following RPC call from the same host:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "system_localPeerId", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
# Output
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"12D3KooWSAhdYsqrJKed3r5HKTJzpEWFUXCFmn6wv85M2woLLJpD","id":1}
```

#### Setting Validator and Sentry Peers

After retrieving the appropriate `PeerId` of both the sentry and validator nodes, we can set them using the following flags:

Start your sentry with `--sentry` flag:

```bash
# Sentry Node
polkadot \
--name "Sentry-A" \
--sentry /ip4/VALIDATOR_VPN_ADDRESS/tcp/30333/p2p/VALIDATOR_NODE_PEER_ID
```

Start the validator with the `--valdiator` and `--sentry-nodes` flags:

```bash
# Validator Node
polkadot \
--name "Validator" \
--reserved-only \
--sentry-nodes /ip4/SENTRY_VPN_ADDRESS/tcp/30333/p2p/SENTRY_NODE_PEER_ID \
--validator
```

You should see your validator has 1 peer, that is a connection from your sentry node. Do the above steps to spin up few more if you think one sentry node is not enough.

> Note: You may have to start the sentry node first in order for the validator node to recognize it as a peer. If it does not show up as a peer, try resrtarting the validator node after the sentry is already running.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a validator with a public facing node and now have a more secure way of running your validator.
