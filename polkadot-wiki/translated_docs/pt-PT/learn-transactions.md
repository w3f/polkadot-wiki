Transactions are used to send a balance to another user. To begin sending transactions, we will learn how to begin sending transactions by using the Polkadot User Interface.

## Polkadot UI

Let's begin by opening up the [Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). There are two ways to make a transaction: by using the Transfer tab in the sidebar or through the Accounts tab. We will be starting off with the Accounts tab, so head there.

Assuming that you've already [created a Polkadot or Kusama account](learn-account-generation), we will click on the 'send' button beside the account you'd like to send from.

Next, there should be a window that pops up displaying the sender, the receiver, the amount, and the existential deposit (minimum amount you must have in your account balance).

Now, if you wanted to send a transaction using the Transfer tab, you'd need to head over to the specific tab and the window will ask you for the same information as before. And that is it!
