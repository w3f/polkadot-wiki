Polkadot is built on top of Substrate, a modular framework for blockchains. One feature of Substrate is to allow for connection to different networks using a single executable and configuring it with a start-up flag. Here are some of the networks associated with Polkadot or Substrate that you may want to connect to and join.

## Polkadot Networks

To connect to a Polkadot network please follow the [instructions](maintain-sync) for installing the Polkadot executable.

### Polkadot Mainnet

The Polkadot mainnet is not released yet. Instructions will be here once the network is available.

### Kusama Canary Network

The Kusama canary network is an early, unaudited version of Polkadot that is running today and holds real economic value.

Currently Kusama is built from the tip of master and is the default option when starting a node.

Run the Polkadot binary:

```
polkadot
```

and you will connect and start syncing to Kusama.

Check your node is connected by viewing it on [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Kusama%20CC3).

### Westend Test Network

Westend is the latest test network for Polkadot. The tokens on this network are called _Westies_ and they purposefully hold no economic value.

Currently Westend is built from the tip of master and requires a commandline flag to access.

Run the Polkadot binary with a `chain` option:

```
polkadot --chain westend
```

and you will connect and start syncing to Westend.

#### Westend Faucet

Follow the instruction [here](learn-DOT#getting-westies) for instructions on acquiring Westies.

Check your node is connected by viewing it on [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Westend).

## Substrate Networks

To connect to a Substrate public network first follow the [instructions](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started) for installing the Substrate executable.

### Flaming Fir

Flaming Fir is the public Substrate test network. It contains some pallets that will not be included in the Polkadot runtime.

Flaming Fir is built from the tip of master and is the default option when running the Substrate executable.

Run Substrate without a flag or explicitly state `fir`:

```
substrate --chain fir
```

and you will connect and start syncing Flaming Fir.

## Telemetry Dashboard

If you connect to the public networks, the default configuration for your node will connect it to the public [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/) service.

You can verify that your node is connected by navigating to the correct network on the dashboard and finding the name of your node.

There is a built-in search function for the nodes page. Simply start typing keystrokes in the main window to make it available.
