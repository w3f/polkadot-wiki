It's time to get started on the Kusama network! Please check out our recommended list for getting started.

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to familiarizing yourself with crytography, blockchain concepts, decentralization, networks, cryptocurrency, and so much more. This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and is also a free course.

For brand-new learners of Kusama:

- [Reading the Kusama Overview page][overview]
- [Reading the "What is Kusama"][medium] article on Medium.
- [Creating a Kusama Account][create-account]
- [Using Kusama endpoints][endpoints]
- [Claiming Kusama KSM tokens][tokens]
- [Running a Validator on Kusama][validator]
- [Staking as a Nominator on Kusama][nominator]

For brand-new learners of Kusama's cousin network, Polkadot, please head over to our [Polkadot Wiki][polkadot wiki].

While Kusama does not support smart contracts natively, building apps on it is still possible (example: [RMRK.app](https://rmrk.app)). If you're interested in diving deeper into _proper_ development however, the [builders guide from Polkadot's wiki][polkadot-builders] applies to Kusama as well.
