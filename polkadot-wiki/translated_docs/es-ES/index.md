Welcome to the Polkadot wiki, the hub for those interested in learning, building, or running a node on the Polkadot protocol. The wiki is sectioned into three major sections to cater to each of these different actors in the Polkadot ecosystem. If you're eager to start building your project to connect to Polkadot, see the [build section](#want-to-build-on-polkadot). If you're interested in operating a node, head on over to the [maintain section](#want-to-run-a-node). And, if you want to learn more then peruse the [learn section](#want-to-learn-more) below.
