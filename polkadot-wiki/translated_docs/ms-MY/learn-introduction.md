Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment.

Polkadot is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permission-less networks, private consortium chains, or oracles and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

Polkadot is a living network with the core pillars of governance and upgradability. The network has an advanced suite of governance tools and, using the WebAssembly standard as a "meta-protocol", can autonomously deploy network upgrades. Polkadot adapts to your growing needs without the risks of network forks.

By connecting these dots, Polkadot serves as a foundational part of a decentralized web, where users control their data and are not limited by trust bounds within the network.

## Why Polkadot?

The Polkadot network is heading towards a future with a secure ecosystem for decentralized applications (built with blockchain technology) to communicate and interact in. Polkadot has deep roots in the blockchain industry and working hard to build on existing blockchain concepts like governance, scalibility, and many more.

Back in the early 2000's, when the internet was gaining popularity for the first time, the internet featured read-only, static, basic webpages. The online connected world at the time was only the beginning of virtual data, identities, and more. The internet during this time was also called the Web 1.0.

As social media platforms and online businesses began to emerge, the internet transformed into the Web 2.0. This upgraded internet, which we still use today, features dynamic, interactive webpages, where users can read and write information plus publish their own for others to see. This version of the web though, comes with downsides dealing with data control, privacy issues, and trust. This is where the Web 3.0 comes into the picture.

The Web 3.0 is taking centralized applications and turning them into decentralized, trust-free protocols. The goal is to transform the internet into a decentralized web, where users control their own data and identity in a trust-free environment. The Web 3.0 movement aims to remove intermediaries and build a trustless infrastructure.

## How does Polkadot work?

The Polkadot network uses a sharded model where shards - called "[parachains](learn-parachains)" - in the network have unique state transition functions (STF). Based on Polkadot's design, as long as a chain's logic can compile to Wasm, then it can connect to the Polkadot network as a parachain.

Polkadot has a Relay Chain acting as the main chain of the system. Parachains construct and propose blocks to validators on the Relay Chain, where the blocks undergo rigorous availability and validity checks before being added to the finalized chain. As the Relay Chain provides the security guarantees, collators don't have any security responsibilities, and thus do not require a robust incentive system.

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g. Bitcoin), Polkadot has [bridge parachains](learn-bridges) that offer two-way compatibility.

The Cross-Chain Messaging Protocol (XCMP) allows parachains to send messages of any type to each other. The shared security and validation logic of the Relay Chain provide the environment for trust-free message passing that opens up true interoperability.
