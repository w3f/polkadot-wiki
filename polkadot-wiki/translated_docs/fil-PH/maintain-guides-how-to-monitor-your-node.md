This guide will walk you through how to set up [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to monitor your node using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04.

A Substrate-based chain exposes data such as the height of the chain, the number of connected peers to your node, CPU, memory usage of your machine, and more. To monitor this data, Prometheus is used to collect metrics and Grafana allows for displaying them on the dashboard.

## Preparation

First, create a user for Prometheus by adding the `--no-create-home` flag to disallow `prometheus` from logging in.

```bash
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus
```

Create the directories required to store the configuration and executable files.

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
```

Change the ownership of these directories to `prometheus` so that only prometheus can access them.

```bash
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```

## Installing and Configuring Prometheus

After setting up the environment, update your OS, and install the latest Prometheus. You can check the latest release by going to their GitHub repository under the [releases](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/) page.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.20.1/prometheus-2.20.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-2.20.1.linux-amd64
```

The following two binaries are in the directory:

- prometheus - Prometheus main binary file
- promtool

The following two directories (which contain the web interface, configuration files examples and the license) are in the directory:

- consoles
- console_libraries

Copy the executable files to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

```bash
sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
```

Change the ownership of these files to the `prometheus` user.

```bash
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
```

Copy the `consoles` and `console_libraries` directories to `/etc/prometheus`

```bash
sudo cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus
sudo cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
```

Change the ownership of these directories to the `prometheus` user.

```bash
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
```

Once everything is done, run this command to remove `prometheus` directory.

```bash
cd .. && rm -rf prometheus*
```

Before using Prometheus, it needs some configuration. Create a YAML configuration file named `prometheus.yml` by running the command below.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

The configuration file is divided into three parts which are `global`, `rule_files`, and `scrape_configs`.

- `scrape_interval` defines how often Prometheus scrapes targets, while `evaluation_interval` controls how often the software will evaluate rules.

- `rule_files` block contains information of the location of any rules we want the Prometheus server to load.

- `scrape_configs` contains the information which resources Prometheus monitors.

The configuration file should look like this below:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
  - job_name: "substrate_node"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9615"]
```

With the above configuration file, the first exporter is the one that Prometheus exports to monitor itself. As we want to have more precise information about the state of the Prometheus server we reduced the `scrape_interval` to 5 seconds for this job. The parameters `static_configs` and `targets` determine where the exporters are running. The second exporter is capturing the data from your node, and the port by default is `9615`.

You can check the validity of this configuration file by running `promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

Save the configuration file and change the ownership of the file to `prometheus` user.

```bash
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

## Starting Prometheus

To test that Prometheus is set up properly, execute the following command to start it as the `prometheus` user.

```bash
sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
```

The following messages indicate the status of the server. If you see the following messages, your server is set up properly.

```bash

```

Go to `http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9090/graph` to check whether you are able to access the Prometheus interface or not. If it is working, exit the process by pressing on `CTRL + C`.

Next, we would like to automatically start the server during the boot process, so we have to create a new `systemd` configuration file with the following config.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
  Description=Prometheus Monitoring
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

[Service]
  User=prometheus
  Group=prometheus
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
  ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once the file is saved, execute the command below to reload `systemd` and enable the service so that it will be loaded automatically during the operating system's startup.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable prometheus && systemctl start prometheus
```

Prometheus should be running now, and you should be able to access its front again end by re-visiting `IP_ADDRESS:9090/`.

## Installing Grafana

In order to visualize your node metrics, you can use Grafana to query the Prometheus server. Run the following commands to install it first.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig1
wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana_7.1.3_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i grafana_7.1.3_amd64.deb
```

If everything is fine, start the Grafana server and access it by going to the `http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:3000/login`. The default user and password is admin/admin.

Now configure Grafana to auto-start on boot.

> Note: If you want to change the port on which Grafana runs (3000 is a popular port), edit the file `/usr/share/grafana/conf/defaults.ini` with a command like `sudo vim /usr/share/grafana/conf/defaults.ini` and change the `http_port` value to something else. Then restart grafana with `sudo systemctl restart grafana-server`.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable grafana-server && sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/1-grafana-login.png)

In order to visualize the node metrics, click _settings_ to configure the `Data Sources` first.

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/2-add-data-source.png)

Click `Add data source` to choose where the data is coming from.

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/2-add-data-source-2.png)

Select `Prometheus`.

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/3-select-prometheus.png)

The only thing you need to input is the `URL` that is `https://localhost:9090` and then click `Save & Test`. If you see `Data source is working`, your connection is configured correctly.

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/4-configure-data-source.png)

Next, import the dashboard that lets you visualize your node data. Go to the menu bar on the left and mouse hover "+" then select `Import`.

`Import via grafana.com` - It allows you to use a dashboard that someone else has created and made public. You can check what other dashboards are available via [https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards). In this guide, we use ["My Polkadot Metrics"](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12425), so input "12425" under the id field and click `Load`.

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/5-import-dashboard.png)

Once it has been loaded, make sure to select "Prometheus" in the Prometheus dropdown list. Then click `Import`.

![grafana-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/5-import-dashboard-2.png)

In the meantime, start your Polkadot node by running `./polkadot`. If everything is done correctly, you should be able to monitor your node's performance such as the current block height, CPU, memory usage, etc. on the Grafana dashboard.

## Installing and Configuring Alertmanager (Optional)

In this section, let's configure the Alertmanager that helps to predict the potential problem or notify you of the current problem in your server. Alerts can be sent in Slack, Email, Matrix, or others. In this guide, we will show you how to configure the email notifications using Gmail if your node goes down.

First, download the latest binary of AlertManager and unzip it by running the command below:

```
wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.21.0/alertmanager-0.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz)
tar -xvzf alertmanager-0.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv alertmanager-0.21.0.linux-amd64/alertmanager /usr/local/bin/
```

### Gmail Setup

To allow AlertManager to send an email to you, you will need to generate something called an `app password` in your Gmail account. For details, click [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to follow the whole setup.

You should see something like below:

![grafana-am-1](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/1-alert-manager.png)

Copy and save it somewhere else first.

### AlertManager Configuration

There is a configuration file named `alertmanager.yml` inside the directory that you just extracted in the previous command, but that is not of our use. We will create our `alertmanager.yml` file under `/etc/alertmanager` with the following config.

> Ensure to change the ownership of "/etc/alertmanager" to `prometheus` by executing
>
> sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/alertmanager

```
global:
 resolve_timeout: 1m

route:
 receiver: 'gmail-notifications'

receivers:
- name: 'gmail-notifications'
  email_configs:
  - to: YOUR_EMAIL
    from: YOUR_EMAIL
    smarthost: smtp.gmail.com:587
    auth_username: YOUR_EMAIL
    auth_identity: YOUR_EMAIL
    auth_password: YOUR_APP_PASSWORD
    send_resolved: true
```

With the above configuration, alerts will be sent using the the email you set above. Remember to change `YOUR_EMAIL` to your email and paste the app password you just saved earlier to the `YOUR_APP_PASSWORD`.

Next, create another `systemd` configuration file named `alertmanager.service` by running the command `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service` with the following config.

> SERVER_IP - Change to your host IP address amd make sure port 9093 is opened

```
[Unit]
Description=AlertManager Server Service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=root
Group=root
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/alertmanager --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml --web.external-url=http://SERVER_IP:9093 --cluster.advertise-address='0.0.0.0:9093'


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To the start the Alertmanager, run the following commands:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start alertmanager && systemctl enable alertmanager && systemctl status alertmanager
```

```
● alertmanager.service - AlertManager Server Service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-08-20 22:01:21 CEST; 3 days ago
 Main PID: 20592 (alertmanager)
    Tasks: 70 (limit: 9830)
   CGroup: /system.slice/alertmanager.service
```

You should see the process status is "active (running)" if you have configured properly.

There is a Alertmanager plugin in Grafana that can help you to monitor the alert information. To install it, execute the command below:

```
sudo grafana-cli plugins install camptocamp-prometheus-alertmanager-datasource
```

And restart Grafana once the plugin is successfully installed.

```
sudo service grafana-server restart
```

Now go to your Grafana dashboard `SERVER_IP:3000` and configure the Alertmanager datasource.

![grafana-am-5](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/5-alert-manager.png)

Go to Configuration -> Data Sources, search "Prometheus AlertManger" if you cannot find it at the top.

![grafana-am-2](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/2-alert-manager.png)

Fill in the `URL` to your server location followed by the port number used in the Alertmanager.

Then click "Save & Test" at the bottom to test the connection.

![grafana-am-3](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/3-alert-manager.png)

To monitor the alerts, let's import dashboard "[8010](https://grafana.com/dashboards/8010)" that is used for Alertmanager. And make sure to select the "Prometheus AlertManager" in the last column. Then click "Import".

You will end up having the follwing:

![grafana-am-4](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/4-alert-manager.png)

### AlertManager Integration

To let the Prometheus server be able to talk to the Alertmanger, we will need to add the following config in the `etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

```
rule_files:
  - 'rules.yml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - localhost:9093
```

That is the updated `etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

```
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - 'rules.yml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - localhost:9093

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'substrate_node'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9615']
```

We will need to create a new file called "rules.yml" under `/etc/prometheus/` that is defined all the rules we would like to detect. If any of the rules defined in this file is fulfilled, an alert will be triggered. The rule below checks whether the instance is down. If it is down for more than 5 minutes, an email notification will be sent. If you would like to learn more about the details of the rule defining, go [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/). There are other interesting alerts you may find useful [here](https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to/rules.html).

```
groups:
  - name: alert_rules
    rules:
      - alert: InstanceDown
        expr: up == 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Instance [{{ $labels.instance }}] down"
          description: "[{{ $labels.instance }}] of job [{{ $labels.job }}] has been down for more than 1 minute."
```

Change the ownership of this file to `prometheus` instead of `root` by running:

```
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus rules.yml
```

To check the rules defined in the "rules.yml" is syntactically correct, run the following command:

```
promtool check rules rules.yml
```

Finally, restart everthing by running:

```
sudo systemctl stop prometheus && systemctl start prometheus &&  systemctl stop alertmanager && systemctl start alertmanager
```

Now if one of your target instances down, you will receive an alert on the AlertManager and Gmail like below.

![grafana-am-6](assets/guides/how-to-monitor/6-alert-manager.png)
