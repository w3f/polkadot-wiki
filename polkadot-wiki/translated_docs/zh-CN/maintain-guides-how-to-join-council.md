议会是经在链上选举产生的账户，旨在代表在 Polkadot / Kusama 被动利益相关者。议会在治理方面有两项主要任务: 提议公投和否决危险或恶意的公投。有关议会的更多信息，请参见[治理页面](learn-governance#council)。本指南将引导您如何参选成为候选人。

## 成为候选人

Submitting your candidacy for the council requires a small bond of DOT / KSM. The bond will be forfeited if your candidacy does not win or become a runner-up and will be kept otherwise. You only receive your bond back, if you manually renounce your candidacy before losing. Runners-up are selected after every round and are reserved members in case one of the winners gets forcefully removed.

> Currently the bond for submitting a council candidacy on Polkadot is 100 DOT, and 0.1666 KSM on Kusama.

在提交参选候选人之前，最好先宣布您的意向，使您的支持者知道何时可以开始投票。如果没有其他人投票给你，你也可以投票给自己。

前往 [ Polkadot Apps ](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) 并选择 "Council"。按下右边写 "Submit Candidacy"。

After making the transaction, you will see your account appear underneath the row "Candidates."

现在最好以身作则，先投给自己。

## 投票给候选人

在提交成为候选人的旁边是 "Vote" 的按钮。您可以按下此投票给自己(可选)。

The council uses [Phragmén](learn-phragmen) approval voting, which is also used in the validator elections. This means that you can choose up to 16 distinct candidates to vote for and your stake will equalize between them. For this guide, choose to approve your own candidacy by clicking on the switch next to your account and changing it to say "Aye."

If you are one of the lucky ones to win a council election you will see your account move underneath the row "Members".
