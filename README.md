  The Polkadot Wiki is the central source of truth for Polkadot. It is a community-focused initiative led by 
  Web3 Foundation to keep an up-to-date resource on the best information for learning, building, or maintaining 
  on Polkadot. 
</p>

## Contributing to Documentation

[The Technical Education team](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/contributors) at Web3 Foundation
are the primary maintainers of the Wiki and will review all issues and pull requests created on this
repository. If you notice typos or grammatical errors, please feel free to create pull requests with
these corrections directly. Larger contributions may start as issues to test the waters on the
subject with the maintainers. It is generally preferable to create a pull request over an issue to

## Running Locally

- Make sure `python` (Python 3.12) and `pip` are installed and in your path
- It's recommended to use a virtual environment, as is common practice
  
1. Enter a virtual environment:
```sh
# Create the env
python -m venv venv
# Enter the env
source venv/bin/activate
```

1. Install dependencies (make sure you're in the project's directory)
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Once installed, run the serve command:
```sh
# If you're in a virtual env (set to false if you're not editing RPC commands, otherwise it will take time to load)
ENABLE_RPC=false mkdocs serve
# If you're not in a virtual env
python -m mkdocs build
```

### Build

üü£ Building the Polkadot Wiki:

```bash
# If you're in a virtual env (set to false if you're not editing RPC commands, otherwise it will take time to load)
ENABLE_RPC=false mkdocs build
# If you're not in a virtual env
python -m mkdocs build
```

## Style and Configuration Guide

Use the style guide from the
[Substrate Knowledge Base](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/knowledgebase/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-style)

### Formatting

See the [Conditional Rendering](#conditional-rendering) and
[Mkdocs Macros](#mkdocs-macros) sections for additional details regarding how to
properly format syntax for elements outside of the standard markdown library.

### Automation

#### Deployments

The Polkadot Wiki is built in a CI job, where it is then deployed on Netlify. Each commit to master triggers a new build and subsequent deployment.

Pull request previews are enabled, meaning a temporary deployment via Netlify is generated per PR.

After these jobs are completed, the CICD production workflow will automatically deploy
`prod` to the public site: [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network).

### Conditional Rendering

The Polkadot Wiki does not support conditional rendering. If needed, represent multiple chains (i.e, Polkadot and Kusama) using the tab layout specified here on the[ Mkdocs Material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/#usage).

### Mkdocs Macros

Mkdocs macros allow the use of Jinja2 templates and custom Python functions to allow for custom data fetching and rendering within Mkdocs. All current macros can be found in: [`macros/`](./macros/). 

#### RPC Macro Example

For example, the `rpc` macro can be used in the following manner, with each field representing the input for the function signature respectively.

1. `rpc` macro function signature:

```py
def rpc(network, module, call, default_value, is_constant=False, readable="")
```

2. Example Usage:

```md
## Number of Nominators
{{ rpc("polkadot", "Staking", "CounterForNominators", 36793, is_constant=false) }}
```

3. Different types of readable, depending on usage and network: 
    * Percentage
    * Human Readable / Human Readable Kusama (rounds to nearest 100)
    * Blocks to days (converts blocks to days)
    * Precise DOT / KSM (returns an unrounded number with full precision)

## Internationalization

| ‚ùó The Wiki is currently being reorganized and updated. Work will resume on translations after the Wiki revamp is completed. |
