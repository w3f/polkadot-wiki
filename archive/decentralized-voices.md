description: Explore the Decentralized Voices Program and its role in Polkadot OpenGov governance.

The Decentralized Voices program empowered broader community participation in
[Polkadot OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) by
[delegating](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#multirole-delegation) DOT and KSM for voting power.

## Decentralized Votes

In line with the Foundation's ethos around decentralization, this program sought to amplify the voices of passionate and
knowledgeable participants who may lack significant holdings, aiming to mitigate potential
marginalization. This initiative did not impact previously existing programs like [Decentralize Nodes](https://medium.com/web3foundation/web3-foundation-is-sunsetting-the-decentralized-nodes-program-761b70b1a468), as
[the tokens allocated can be used for both staking and governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#voluntary-locking-conviction-voting).

## How to Apply

Information requested for applications included the following:

- The account address to which you would like to have DOT or KSM delegated. This account must have a
  verified identity, including at least one of the following fields: X (formerly Twitter), Matrix
  (Element), or email.
- A link to a _publicly accessible_ declaration of your Polkadot “political philosophy” and/or
  agenda on the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/). This can include an actual
  philosophical statement, analogies to other political philosophies, opinions on previous Referenda
  or governance decisions, or any other way you would like to explain to people how you would vote
  in the future. This should be at least one paragraph.
- A description of why you would be a good choice for this program. This can include such
  information as previous votes (including votes with other accounts if you can prove you own them),
  as well as commentary, blog posts, etc., on Polkadot OpenGov or specific referenda. It can also
  include other information that you would consider relevant to decision making, e.g., being part of
  other political groups or legislative bodies.

The Decentralized Voices program initially designated delegates who will be receiving delegated
funds. In addition to the platforms mentioned above, to expand their reach, participants could showcase their governance contributions and political philosophy through public declarations and
active engagement (optionally) on other social media platforms such as Reddit and Discord.

Delegations were subject to review, and non-compliance may have resulted in the revocation of their status.

The Decentralized Voices program [commenced on **February 6, 2024**](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-program-93623c27ae43) and it was [sunset 
on **December 23, 2025**](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-closing-this-chapter-carrying-the-lessons-forward-e10d3a46a7b6). It offered an opportunity for dedicated community members to shape the future of the Polkadot ecosystem.
