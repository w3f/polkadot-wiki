/**
 * The wiki hosts both the Polkadot Wiki and the Kusama User Guide. This means
 * that we can "mirror" the same document between the two. However, due to
 * a peculiarity in Docusaurus, when we put the same document into both sub-wikis
 * in `website/sidebars.json` only the most recent entry is read.
 *
 * To solve this, we create an explicit mirror of the document. The process for
 * adding content to both wikis is as follows:
 *
 * 1) Create the source document and put it under the relevant sidebar in the
 *    Polkadot wiki configuration in `sidebars.json`.
 * 2) Add the source document's name to the `mirrored` array below.
 * 3) Run `node mirror.js`.
 * 4) Add `mirror-DOCUMENT_NAME` to the sidebar for Kusama in `sidebars.json`.
