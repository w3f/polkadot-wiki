## Polkadot's White Paper

Polkadot's original white paper is a technical summary around one possible direction of implementing
the Polkadot network. This paper uses rationale and technical details to support why this direction
is beneficial. This original white paper also explains how each core component in Polkadot works
together to build this decentralized network. Polkadot's white paper can be found
[here](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf).

## Polkadot's Overview Paper

Polkadot's overview paper is a visual, easy to read, and less technical introduction into its
blockchain technology. This paper dives into the components of Polkadot but is understandable for
both a non-technical and technical reader. For reference, the overview paper can be found
[here](https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf).

## The Polkadot Specification

[Polkadot's specification](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-spec) is a Github Repo that holds the
latest Polkadot Host Protocol specification, Polkadot's specification tests of the many components
on the network, and the Polkadot Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and explores how
various processes function in the Polkadot network. The Polkadot specification takes Polkadot's
ideas and concepts from the overview and the white paper but focuses on the technical specs of the
technology.
