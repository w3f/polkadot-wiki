WebAssembly is used in Polkadot and Substrate as the compilation target for the runtime.

## What is WebAssembly?

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
