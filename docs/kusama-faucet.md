Due to high demand, as well as spammers causing problems for regular users, the Kusama faucet has
been shut down. Web3 Foundation will consider new ways to distribute KSM for people who need KSM to
build.

If you are interested in obtaining KSM now for building or research, you can apply through the
Treasury or receive a tip.

### Support:

If you are having difficulties using the faucet, please join the
[Kusama Watercooler chat](https://riot.w3f.tech/#/room/#kusamawatercooler:polkadot.builders) and
somebody will try to help you.
