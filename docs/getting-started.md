Welcome to the Polkadot Wiki! This wiki contains guides for interacting with the core functionality.
Our wiki has three main sections: Learn (for learners), Build (for people that want to build on
Polkadot), and Maintain (for people that want to maintain the network).

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to familiarizing yourself
  with crytography, blockchain concepts, decentralization, networks, crytocurrency, and so much
  more. This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and is also a free course.

For brand-new learners of Polkadot:

- [Polkadot's original white paper][white-paper] is a technical summary around one possible
  direction of implementing the Polkadot network. This paper uses rationale and technical details to
  support why this direction is beneficial. This original white paper also explains how Polkadot's
  core components work together to build this decentralized network.
- [Polkadot's overview paper][overview-paper] is an updated version of the white paper that
  describes the protocol in more technical terms. We would recommend reading this overview paper if
  you are interested in digging more into the protocol itself.
- [Polkadot's light paper][light-paper] is a visual, easy to read, and less technical introduction
  into its blockchain technology. This paper dives into the components of Polkadot but is
  understandable for both a non-technical and technical reader.
- [Polkadot's specification][spec] is a Github repository that holds the latest Polkadot Host
  protocol specification, Polkadot's specification tests of the many components of the network, and
  the Polkadot Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and explores how various processes
  function in the Polkadot network. The Polkadot specification takes Polkadot's ideas and concepts
  from the light and the white paper but focuses on the technical specs of the technology.
- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos][teched videos]: These are great introductory videos that
  explain and demonstrate how to use Polkadot and its [User Interface][ui].
- Reading [What is Polkadot? A Brief Introduction][article] on Medium. There are also other great
  articles to read on [Polkadot's Medium][p medium] or [Web3 Foundation's Medium][w medium].
- [Creating a Polkadot Account][account generation]
- [Sending a Balance transfer][transfer]
- [Staking as Nominator][nominator]
- [Running a Validator][validator]
- [Setting an Identity][identity]
- [Creating a Proxy Account][proxy]
- [Making Proposals and Voting for Referenda][democracy]
- Social Recovery (Coming soon!)
- [Running for the Council][council]
- [Voting for Councillors][council voting]
- [Using the Treasury][treasury]

For brand-new learners of Kusama: To learn more about how to build and maintain on the Kusama
network, please head over to our [Kusama Guide][kusama guide].
