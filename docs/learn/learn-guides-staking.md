## Claiming Rewards with the Polkadot-JS UI

Anyone can trigger a payout for any validator, as long as they are willing to pay the transaction
fee. Someone must submit a transaction with a validator ID and an era index.
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} will automatically calculate that
validator's reward, find the top
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator" defaultValue={512}/> :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator" defaultValue={512}/> :kusama }}
nominators for that era, and distribute the rewards pro rata.

:::note

The Staking system only applies the highest
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator" defaultValue={512}/> :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator" defaultValue={512}/> :kusama }}
nominations to each validator to reduce the complexity of the staking set.

:::

These details are handled for you automatically if you use the
[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/payout), which also allows you to submit
batches of eras at once.

To claim rewards on Polkadot-JS UI, you will need to be in the "Payouts" tab underneath "Staking",
which will list all the pending payouts for your stashes.

To then claim your reward, select the "Payout all" button. This will prompt you to select your stash
accounts for payout.

Once you are done with payout, another screen will appear asking for you to sign and submit the
transaction.
