## Your Keys, Your Responsibility

Account abstraction addresses the challenges of managing cryptographic keys representing accounts on
blockchains and, more generally, your digital identity. In Web3, you digitally
sign any transaction or, more generally, any message using your private key. Data are recorded on a
public ledger (blockchain) whose multiple copies of it are stored in computers participating in a
P2P network. Assuming the network is sufficiently decentralized (meaning that those computers do not
belong to a few operators), those computers do not own your data, you do since you can verify you
signed them with your key.

While they grant users control and ownership, losing keys results in a loss of digital assets and a
loss and fragmentation of your digital identity since you will need to create a new account with a
new key after losing a key. This poses a hurdle for both users and developers regarding security and
adoption.

## Definition of Account Abstraction

Account abstraction introduces a layer of on-chain logic that controls an account, typically in the
form of a smart contract. This abstracts some key management complexities, reducing the likelihood
of compromise. It allows for dynamic changes in an accountâ€™s operation without altering the core
protocol.

The term _abstraction_ refers to separating the user experience from the private key, enabling a
piece of code to dictate account behavior. In Ethereum, this is achieved through smart contracts,
while the highly generic codebase of Polkadot's architecture makes accounts natively more flexible
and abstract without the direct need for smart contracts.

## Account Abstraction in Polkadot

While the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) does not have a single pallet
(module) for complete account abstraction, it incorporates various pallets that collectively achieve
similar functionalities. These include:

- [proxy accounts](./learn-proxies.md) for role-based representation, and ownership representation
  through [pure proxies](./learn-proxies.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy)
- [multi-signature accounts](./learn-account-multisig.md) to control an account using different ones
- account recovery mechanisms such as social recovery to help regain access to your key using
  trusted third-party accounts
- [batching functionality](./learn-balance-transfers.md#batch-transfers) to submit multiple calls in
  one single transaction
- payments with non-native tokens

All the above can be used together, meaning that, for example, you can create a multi-signature
account of pure proxies to keep the same multi-signature account when signatories change.

Additionally, developers have the flexibility to design their own rules for abstraction.

Adopting a generic design is crucial in scaling Web3 technologies. Abstraction and generalization
like account abstraction are crucial steps towards improving user experience and security in
blockchain adoption.
