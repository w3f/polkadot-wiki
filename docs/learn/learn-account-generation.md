An address is the public part of a Polkadot account. The private part is the key used to access this
address. The public and private parts together make up a Polkadot account. You can think about your public address like your mailbox and your private key like your key to open your mailbox. Everybody can send you information to your public address, but only you can access the box and read such information. In other words, everybody can know your public address but you should keep your private key secret.
