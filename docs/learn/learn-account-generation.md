## DISCLAIMER: Key Security

The _only_ ways to access your account are via your secret seed or your account's JSON file in
combination with a password. Keep them offline in a secure and private location. If you share these
with anyone, they can access your account, including your funds. This information is always a target
for hackers and malicious actors. Check out the wiki doc on
[how to recognize scams](../general/scams.md).

## Ways to Generate an Account

:::info Treasury-funded Wallets and Browser Extensions

If you are a general user, you are recommended to create accounts using any of the
[wallets and extensions](../general/wallets-and-extensions.md) funded by the Treasury or Grants. If
you are a power user or a developer, you can use
[Polkadot-JS Extension](../general/polkadotjs.md#polkadot-js-extension).

:::

When you create accounts using browser extensions like
[the Polkadot-JS extension](#polkadot-js-browser-extension), it stores your accounts in a private
vault and lets you clear your browser cache without fear. Remember to back up your seed phrase - if
you lose access to this computer or the extension somehow crashes beyond repair, the seed phrase
will come in handy. Alternatively, you can create accounts using the
[Polkadot-JS UI](#polkadot-js-ui), although this option is disabled by default. More info about the
Polkadot-JS UI can be found on [the dedicated page](../general/polkadotjs-ui.md).

Please note that all wallets that are connected to the internet are considered "hot wallets" that
are susceptible to a wide range of attacks, so it is recommended to use cold storage when dealing
with non-trivial amounts.

Current popular cold storage solutions within the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem include
[Ledger](../general/ledger.md) and [Polkadot Vault](../general/polkadot-vault.md). The latter keeps
your keys on an air-gapped mobile phone. However, it does require obtaining a dedicated Android or
iOS-compatible phone that you are comfortable using only for Polkadot Vault.

Besides the Polkadot-JS browser extension and the Polkadot-JS UI,
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} addresses can also be created with
the [Subkey tool](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/utils/subkey). Subkey is
intended for users comfortable using the command line and can seem intimidating, but it is quite
approachable. Follow the instructions in the
[Subkey documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/).

## Backing Up Accounts

Depending on what software you use to access your account, there are various ways to back up and
restore your account. It is a good idea to back your information up and keep it secure. In general,
as long as you know how you created your account and have the seed phrase
([mnemonic phrase](learn-accounts#portability)) or JSON file (and password) stored securely, you can
restore your account.

## Ledger Hardware Wallet

To use a Ledger hardware wallet to create your address and keep your tokens in cold storage, follow
the instructions on the [Ledger hardware wallet guide page](../general/ledger.md).

## Polkadot Vault

Parity Signer is a secure way of storing your DOT on an air-gapped device. It is highly recommended
that you turn off wifi, cellular network, Bluetooth, NFC, and any other communications methods after
installing it.

For guidelines about how to create an account using Parity Signer, see
[**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/hgv1R9mPEXw?t=120) and visit
[**this support article**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000180512-how-to-create-an-account-in-parity-signer).

[**this support article**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account).

:::

The Polkadot-JS Browser Extension (the Polkadot Extension) provides a reasonable balance of security
and usability. It provides a separate local mechanism to generate your address and interact with
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}.

This method involves installing the Polkadot Extension and using it as a â€œvirtual vault," separate
from your browser, to store your private keys. It also allows the signing of transactions and
similar functionality.

It is still running on the same computer you use to connect to the internet and thus is less secure
than using Parity Signer or other air-gapped approaches.

### Reset Password using the Polkadot-JS Browser Extension

:::info

See [**this video tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNU0p5G0Gqc&t=280s) to learn how to
change the password for an account that has been created on the Polkadot-JS browser extension (i.e.
an injected account).

:::

:::warning

Before following the instructions below, make sure you have your mnemonic phrase stored in a safe
place accessible to you.

:::

Let's say you created `ACCOUNT 1` protected by password `PSW 1`. To reset the password of your
`ACCOUNT 1` using the browser extension, you must follow the following steps:

- Go to `ACCOUNT 1` on the browser extension and click "Forget account". This action will delete the
  access to your account. Note that your tokens are still in your account on the
  {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} blockchain network.
- On the browser extension click the "+" button in the top right corner and select the option
  "Import account from pre-existing seed". After entering the mnemonic phrase, you can choose a new
  password, `PSW 2`.

:::info JSON files do not allow changing account passwords

If you add the account to the extension using the option "Restore account from backup JSON file",
this will allow you to restore access to your account using a JSON file protected by the password
`PSW 1`, but does not let you set a new password. Thus, `PSW 1` will become the account password by
default.

:::

:::info Accounts on Cold wallets do not need passwords

For hardware wallets such as [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), you may have to set a PIN for
accessing the accounts on the device, but you do not need to set a password for every individual
account. When you need to make transactions with your account, you are required to sign using your
Ledger device. Also, Ledger wallets let you generate multiple accounts for multiple blockchain
networks without setting different passwords to access such accounts.

:::caution

If you use this method to create your account and clear your cookies in your browser, your account
will be lost forever if you do not [back it up](#restore-account-on-the-polkadot-js-ui). Make sure
you store your seed phrase in a safe place or download the account's JSON file if using the
Polkadot{.js} browser extension. Learn more about account backup and restoration
[here](#restore-account-on-the-polkadot-js-ui).

:::

Local in-browser account storage is disabled by default on the Polkadot-JS UI. To create an account
using the Polkadot-JS UI, navigate to settings > account options and click on allow local in-browser
account storage in the drop-down menu. Using the Polkadot-JS user interface without a browser
extension is **not recommended**. It is the least secure way of generating an account. It should
only be used if all other methods are not feasible.

## Subkey

Subkey is recommended for technically advanced users comfortable with the command line and compiling
Rust code. Subkey lets you generate keys on any device that can compile the code. Subkey may also be
useful for automated account generation using an air-gapped device. It is not recommended for
general users.

## Vanity Generator

The vanity generator is a tool on [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts/vanity)
that lets you generate addresses that contain a specific substring. For the tutorial on how to
create an account using Vanity Generator, visit
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000171416).

## Account Address Format

An account created for {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} can also be
used on multiple chains in the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
ecosystem. More specifically, the account of a chain that uses the `*25519` account address format
(the latest list can be accessed on the
[ss58 registry repository](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json)
is cross-compatible with all the chains that use the similar format. To switch between the accounts
on different chains, you can follow the guidelines in
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000103707-can-i-use-the-same-account-on-polkadot-kusama-and-parachains-).
[Subscan has a tool](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/format_transform) you can use to convert your
address between the different chain formats.

:::info Using the same account on multiple chains - Pros and Cons

The address format differs from chain to chain, but that difference is only visual. The same private
key can be used to sign transactions on behalf of the respective accounts on multiple chains. Using
a single account on multiple chains is convenient, as you do not have to deal with multiple mnemonic
phrases or private keys. But, if your account gets compromised on one chain, the attacker can gain
full access to the accounts on all other chains. This also has implications for the account holder's
privacy, as knowing the identity of an account on one chain can expose the account holder's identity
on all the chains. In the Accounts tab, the Polkadot-JS UI displays a warning message next to each
Account you are using on multiple chains and recommends using different Accounts on different chains
(see below).

![warning multiple chains](../assets/warning-multichain-account.png)

:::

On Polkadot-JS Extension, you can copy your address by clicking the account's icon while the desired
chain format is active. E.g. selecting "Substrate" as the format will change your address, and
clicking the colorful icon of your account will copy it in that format. While in
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} mode, that address format will be
copied, and so on.

## Encryption Enhancement

Some newly generated `JSON` account files cannot be imported (restored) into older wallet software.
This is due to an enhanced encryption method, noticeable in a slight delay when
encrypting/decrypting your wallet. If you cannot load a `JSON` file, please use the latest version
of the wallet software. If you cannot load it, ensure that the wallet software uses the newest
version of the [Polkadot API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/).
