Polkadot and Avalanche both have an architecture that allows for application-specific blockchains to
be designed and connected to a primary network. In Polkadot, the primary network is the relay chain
and Avalanche does this with 3 main chains - the P-chain, X-chain, and C-chain. Similar to how
Polkadot has its Parachains that connect to the relay chain, Avalanche has what’s called
[subnets](https://docs.avax.network/subnets). Similar to Polkadot, Avalanche also uses a PoS
mechanism for achieving consensus. The validators stake their AVAX tokens in order to participate in
the PoS system and secure the network.

## Architecture

Avalanche's architecture separates the responsibility of a layer-1 smart contract platform into
three chains. This allows for a separation of concern over validators and consensus, transactions,
and smart contract execution. Avalanche uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure for one of its
chains which is non-linear. Polkadot uses the linear chain structure similar to Bitcoin and
Ethereum. Smart contracts in Polkadot are implemented on
[parachains](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/evm/).

Avalanche's Primary Network is split into three blockchains. 

### P-chain (Platform)

- Maintains the validator set and secures the network.
- Supports staking operations and Avalanche L1s.
- Uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), allowing token holders to delegate their stake to validators.

### X-chain (Exchange)

- Handles the transaction layer using a UTXO model (similar to Bitcoin).
- Implements a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure for fast transaction processing.
- Does not support smart contract execution.

### C-chain (Contracts)

- Supports EVM-compatible smart contracts.
- Runs the Coreth VM, a fork of go-ethereum with Avalanche-specific networking and consensus.
- Focuses on high activity for smart contract execution.

### Subnets

Avalanche defines a subnet as a dynamic set of validators that achieve consensus on a set of
blockchains. In Polkadot's terminology, Subnets can be viewed as public or private blockchain
runtimes that can be built on top of the primary network and allow a subset of the validators to
validate these runtimes. Similar to the Parachains on Polkadot, Subnets provide the freedom to
choose the transaction fee model, tokenomics, and custom compile rules. One or many validators can
start validating a subnet runtime, effectively becoming a subset of the overall validator set of the
Primary Network.

#### Virtual Machines

Avalanche uses Virtual Machines (VMs) as blueprints for defining blockchain behavior, including state 
transitions, transaction rules, and API interfaces. Developers can use the same VM to create multiple 
independent blockchains with identical rules.

For example, Avalanche's Primary Network requires validators to run three core VMs:

Avalanche allows developers to build custom VMs for advanced use cases. These custom VMs 
can be implemented in any programming language and communicate with Avalanche using a language-agnostic 
RPC protocol. Developers can also use the Subnet-EVM for quick deployment of Solidity-based blockchains 
or create fully custom VMs for maximum flexibility.

In contrast, Polkadot does not have a native smart contract layer. Instead, its EVM and WASM smart 
contract capabilities are implemented on parachains. Parachains on Polkadot are independent blockchains 
that connect to the relay chain and share its security. Its parachain model allows developers to build highly customized blockchain 
runtimes using the Polkadot SDK, a modular framework for blockchain development. These runtimes (state transition functions for Polkadot parachains/rollups) are compiled to WASM.

This difference highlights Avalanche's focus on VM-based blockchain customization and Polkadot's 
emphasis on shared security and modular runtime development.

## Consensus

![avalanche-consensus-protocols](../assets/comparisons/avalanche/avalanche-consensus-protocols.png)

Avalanche consensus uses a family of protocols to achieve security, liveness, and finality. These
are known as the Snow\* protocols. This group of protocols composed together uses both classical and
Nakamoto consensus as well as a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system for its block creators.

The [Snow family](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-consensus) is a
hierarchical collection of systems used to reach finality on Avalanche:

- Slush
- Snowflake
- Snowball
- Avalanche
- Snowman
- Slushie

Compared to Polkadot, Avalanche uses an asynchronous hybrid system that is based on a classical and
Nakomoto approach. Polkadot uses a synchronous hybrid model that combines
[BABE](learn-consensus.md#block-production-babe) and
[GRANDPA](learn-consensus.md#finality-gadget-grandpa), where BABE is the algorithm used to build blocks
in a probabilistic way, and GRANDPA is a finality mechanism that uses a deterministic approach to
adding blocks to the longest chain. In the end, validators agree to whole chains, rather than single
new blocks.

### Snowball

The snowball protocol is an algorithm that nodes use to come to a consensus. Each node continuously
queries x number of validators and takes the majority consensus and adopts it as its own. This
method, in normal circumstances, will lead to the network reaching a consensus. The scalability of
Snowball is promising, as the number of participants in the network grows, the number of consensus
messages being passed around remains the same. Nodes will query no more than 20 nodes at a given
time.

### DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)

[DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) are graphs consisting of vertices and
edges. In Avalanche they are used for **partial ordering** of decisions, such as transactions.
Vertices point to each other using edges, and when ordered topologically vertices and edges create a
sequence. Edges in the case of Avalanche can be conflicting, and nodes will use the snowball
algorithm to make decisions about which edges to keep and which to not.

## Staking Mechanics

Avalanche uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism without any [slashing](./learn-offenses.md). The
barrier to entry for staking as a full node validator is 2500 AVAX, and 25 AVAX to become a
delegator. With a minimum stake period being two weeks and a maximum period being a year, for both
validators and delegators. It is not clear from the Avalanche documentation what happens after a
year, it is likely that validators will have to re-stake and start a new period. Validators acquire
points for uptime and correctness of their work, and the remuneration of rewards depends on that.

In Polkadot the minimum stake needed to be a validator is variable, same for being a nominator. The
true minimum need to be competitive enough to be included in the active set for validators, or
successfully being chosen as a nominator depends on the minimum staked amounts on the network at a
given time. Read more about this in the [staking page](learn-staking.md).

<!-- Staking points and how they are occurred is not clear in the documentation -->

## Message Passing

Avalanche has introduced [Avalanche Interchain Messaging (ICM)](https://build.avax.network/docs/cross-chain/avalanche-warp-messaging/overview), 
a native cross-chain communication protocol that allows subnets to exchange messages securely and trustlessly. 
ICM enables interoperability between subnets by leveraging cryptographic proofs to ensure message integrity. 
This is a significant improvement over relying solely on bridges for communication. However, ICM is limited 
to subnets within the Avalanche ecosystem and does not extend to external blockchains.

Polkadot, with its [XCM](learn-xcm.md) and [XCMP](learn-xcm-transport.md#xcmp-cross-chain-message-passing) messaging protocols, 
provides a native and trustless messaging scheme that supports the composability of chains and enables the development 
of powerful cross-chain applications. Unlike ICM, XCM extends beyond Polkadot's ecosystem, allowing for broader interoperability.

## Governance

According to its whitepaper, Avalanche plans to have an on-chain governance mechanism. It currently
does not have an on-chain or off-chain system in production. Its governance system will limited to
updating only a few key protocol parameters which include:

- **Staking amount:** This value defines the minimal stake required to be placed as bond before
  participating in the system.
- **Minimum staking time for a node:** The minimal amount of time required for a node to stake into
  the system.
- **Maximum staking time for a node:** The maximal amount of time a node can stake.
- **Minting rate:** Reward rate function, also referred to as minting rate, determines the reward a
  participant can claim as a function of their staking amount given some number of x publicly
  disclosed nodes under its ownership, over a period of t consecutive _minimal staking time_
  timeframes, such that t*minimal staking time* ≤ _maximum staking time_.
- **Transaction fee amount:** The fee structure, which is a set of governable fees parameters that
  specify costs to various transactions.

Limiting the governance functionality is a design choice to increase predictability and safety.

Polkadot's governance mechanism has been in production from the very beginning and was used to
slowly release functionality and decentralize the initial network. It is also not limited to a few
parameters and in fact, the whole runtime is subject to change via protocol making Polkadot a
meta-protocol.

## Upgrades

The upgrades to Avalanche are administered by the protocol developers at
[Ava Labs](https://www.avalabs.org/). On Polkadot, the forkless upgrades are administered and
deployed through the on-chain governance. When performing upgrades, every single validator on the
Subnet will need to perform the identical upgrade. This requires a co-ordination effort among the
Validators of the Subnet. On Polkadot, upgrades to Parachains can be deployed automatically without
any coordination with the Validators on the relaychain.

## Conclusion

Avalanche has made some design decisions that allow for an improved smart-contract development
environment in which protocol engineers can have the freedom to create their own blockchains and
include them in the Avalanche ecosystem via subnets. The trade-offs are that the autonomy of design
is limited and blockchains have to buy into the design decisions of Avalanche's main chains. Unlike
parachains on Polkadot, Subnets are not able to share the security of the main chains. In addition
to utilizing block finality and security of the relay chain, parachains on Polkadot use
[XCM](learn-xcm.md) to pass native trustless messages, instead of having to rely on multiple bridging
solutions. However, Subnets are easier to launch compared to parachains, given that they only
require a recommended minimum of 5 validators, making the costs of launch predictable. Avalanche
has plans to implement shared security, interoperability, composability, and on-chain governance
features, but these are already offered by Polkadot.
