Polkadot and Avalanche both have an architecture that allows for application-specific blockchains to
be designed and connected to a primary network. In Polkadot, the primary network is the relay chain
and Avalanche does this with 3 main chains - the P-chain, X-chain, and C-chain. Similar to how
Polkadot has its Parachains that connect to the relay chain, Avalanche has what’s called
[subnets](https://docs.avax.network/subnets). Similar to Polkadot, Avalanche also uses a PoS
mechanism for achieving consensus. The validators stake their AVAX tokens in order to participate in
the PoS system and secure the network.

## Architecture

Avalanche's architecture separates the responsibility of a layer-1 smart contract platform into
three chains. This allows for a separation of concern over validators and consensus, transactions,
and smart contract execution. Avalanche uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure for one of its
chains which is non-linear. Polkadot uses the linear chain structure similar to Bitcoin and
Ethereum. Smart contracts in Polkadot are implemented on
[parachains](build-smart-contracts#parachains). Polkadot being a layer-0 blockchain, is not a smart
contract platform and does not have plans to support them natively.

#### P-chain (Platform)

The P-chain is responsible for maintaining the validator set and securing the network. AVAX token
holders can spin up their own nodes and become validators by staking their tokens. Similar to the
NPoS system that Polkadot uses, Avalanche uses a Delegated PoS which allows token holders to also
delegate their token stake to existing validators instead of running their own nodes.

#### X-chain (Exchange)

The X-chain is responsible for the transaction layer of the Avalanche blockchain. It uses a UTXO
model like Bitcoin whereas Polkadot uses an account model like Ethereum. This is the only chain that
implements the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) model for its blockchain, making this the fastest chain
on the Avalanche network. This chain does not support smart contract execution.

#### C-chain (Contracts)

The C-chain is where the most activity will happen on the Avalanche network. It allows for different
virtual machines to execute smart contract code. Out of the box, it has support for EVM and AVM
(Avalanche VM). C-Chain runs a fork of go-ethereum called coreth that has the networking and
consensus portions replaced with Avalanche equivalents.

As Polkadot does not have a smart contract layer out of the box, the EVM and WASM smart contract
abilities lie in the Parachain layers. This is a major difference between Polkadot and Avalanche.
The smart-contract abilities of Avalanche are baked into its three-chain model.

#### Subnets or sub-networks

Avalanche defines a subnet as a dynamic set of validators that achieve consensus on a set of
blockchains. In Polkadot's terminology, Subnets can be viewed as public or private blockchain
runtimes that can be built on top of the primary network and allow a subset of the validators to
validate these runtimes. Similar to the Parachains on Polkadot, Subnets provide the freedom to
choose the transaction fee model, tokenomics, and custom compile rules. One or many validators can
start validating a subnet runtime, effectively becoming a subset of the overall validator set of the
Primary Network.

## Consensus

![avalanche-consensus-protocols](../assets/comparisons/avalanche/avalanche-consensus-protocols.png)

Avalanche consensus uses a family of protocols to achieve security, liveness, and finality. These
are known as the Snow\* protocols. This group of protocols composed together uses both classical and
Nakamoto consensus as well as a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system for its block creators.

The [Snow family](https://docs.avax.network/overview/getting-started/avalanche-consensus) is a
hierarchical collection of systems used to reach finality on Avalanche:

- Slush
- Snowflake
- Snowball
- Avalanche
- Snowman
- Slushie

Compared to Polkadot, Avalanche uses an asynchronous hybrid system that is based on a classical and
Nakomoto approach. Polkadot uses a synchronous hybrid model that combines
[BABE](learn-consensus#block-production-babe) and
[GRANDPA](learn-consensus#finality-gadget-grandpa), where BABE is the algorithm used to build blocks
in a probabilistic way, and GRANDPA is a finality mechanism that uses a deterministic approach to
adding blocks to the longest chain. In the end, validators agree to whole chains, rather than single
new blocks.

### Snowball

The snowball protocol is an algorithm that nodes use to come to a consensus. Each node continuously
queries x number of validators and takes the majority consensus and adopts it as its own. This
method, in normal circumstances, will lead to the network reaching a consensus. The scalability of
Snowball is promising, as the number of participants in the network grows, the number of consensus
messages being passed around remains the same. Nodes will query no more than 20 nodes at a given
time.

### DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)

[DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) are graphs consisting of vertices and
edges. In Avalanche they are used for **partial ordering** of decisions, such as transactions.
Vertices point to each other using edges, and when ordered topologically vertices and edges create a
sequence. Edges in the case of Avalanche can be conflicting, and nodes will use the snowball
algorithm to make decisions about which edges to keep and which to not.

## Staking Mechanics

Avalanche uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism without any [slashing](./learn-offenses.md). The
barrier to entry for staking as a full node validator is 2500 AVAX, and 25 AVAX to become a
delegator. With a minimum stake period being two weeks and a maximum period being a year, for both
validators and delegators. It is not clear from the Avalanche documentation what happens after a
year, it is likely that validators will have to re-stake and start a new period. Validators acquire
points for uptime and correctness of their work, and the remuneration of rewards depends on that.

In Polkadot the minimum stake needed to be a validator is variable, same for being a nominator. The
true minimum need to be competitive enough to be included in the active set for validators, or
successfully being chosen as a nominator depends on the minimum staked amounts on the network at a
given time. Read more about this in the [staking page](learn-staking).

<!-- Staking points and how they are occurred is not clear in the documentation -->

## Message Passing

Avalanche does not have a native trustless message-passing mechanism. Instead, it relies on bridges.
Though, because it is an EVM-compatible protocol, it's able to interoperate at a token level.
However, subnets do not have a messaging layer out of the box. Polkadot, with its [XCM](learn-xcm)
and [XCMP](learn-xcm#xcmp-cross-chain-message-passing) messaging protocols, allows for a native and
trustless messaging scheme, thus supporting the composability of chains and enabling the development
of powerful cross-chain applications.

## Governance

According to its whitepaper, Avalanche plans to have an on-chain governance mechanism. It currently
does not have an on-chain or off-chain system in production. Its governance system will limited to
updating only a few key protocol parameters which include:

- **Staking amount:** This value defines the minimal stake required to be placed as bond before
  participating in the system.
- **Minimum staking time for a node:** The minimal amount of time required for a node to stake into
  the system.
- **Maximum staking time for a node:** The maximal amount of time a node can stake.
- **Minting rate:** Reward rate function, also referred to as minting rate, determines the reward a
  participant can claim as a function of their staking amount given some number of x publicly
  disclosed nodes under its ownership, over a period of t consecutive _minimal staking time_
  timeframes, such that t*minimal staking time* ≤ _maximum staking time_.
- **Transaction fee amount:** The fee structure, which is a set of governable fees parameters that
  specify costs to various transactions.

Limiting the governance functionality is a design choice to increase predictability and safety.

Polkadot's governance mechanism has been in production from the very beginning and was used to
slowly release functionality and decentralize the initial network. It is also not limited to a few
parameters and in fact, the whole runtime is subject to change via protocol making Polkadot a
meta-protocol.

## Upgrades

The upgrades to Avalanche are administered by the protocol developers at
[Ava Labs](https://www.avalabs.org/). On Polkadot, the forkless upgrades are administered and
deployed through the on-chain governance. When performing upgrades, every single validator on the
Subnet will need to perform the identical upgrade. This requires a co-ordination effort among the
Validators of the Subnet. On Polkadot, upgrades to Parachains can be deployed automatically without
any coordination with the Validators on the relaychain.

## Conclusion

Avalanche has made some design decisions that allow for an improved smart-contract development
environment in which protocol engineers can have the freedom to create their own blockchains and
include them in the Avalanche ecosystem via subnets. The trade-offs are that the autonomy of design
is limited and blockchains have to buy into the design decisions of Avalanche's main chains. Unlike
parachains on Polkadot, Subnets are not able to share the security of the main chains. In addition
to utilizing block finality and security of the relay chain, parachains on Polkadot use
[XCM](learn-xcm) to pass native trustless messages, instead of having to rely on multiple bridging
solutions. However, Subnets are easy to launch when compared to parachains, given that they only
need a recommended minimum of 5 validators, which make the costs of launch predictable. Avalanche
has plans to implement shared security, interoperability, composability and on-chain governance
features which are already offered by Polkadot.
