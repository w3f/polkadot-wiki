DOT is an inflationary token, with
[**fixed annual expansion of the token supply of 120,000,000 DOT**](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/471),
of which 15% goes to the [treasury](./learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md) and 85% to
[stakers](./learn-staking.md).

It is essential to understand that the primary objective of inflation is to incentivize network
participants through
[Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](./learn-consensus.md#nominated-proof-of-stake) and to grow the
network through funding the on-chain treasury. The token inflation rate can be updated through
[on-chain governance](./learn-polkadot-opengov.md) based on thorough tokenomics research.

Below is a 25-year prediction of DOT gross annual inflation (red line) and DOT total issuance (blue
line), assuming the current fixed inflation rate.

![inflation](../assets/dot-inflation.png)

The total issuance takes into account the gross DOT inflation and thus does not consider tokens that
are burned.

Net DOT inflation depends on [treasury burns](./learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md) and
[coretime sales](./learn-agile-coretime.md#agile-coretime-implementation) that are variables and
thus cannot be predicted. Net inflation can be defined as follows:

```

Net Inflation = Gross fixed inflation - burned supply (treasury + coretime sales)

```

Where `Gross fixed inflation` is the annual inflation of 120M DOT and the `burned supply` is the
annual burn supply due to treasury burns and coretime sale burns.
