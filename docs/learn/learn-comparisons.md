## Rollup Comparison

**Rollups** are an L2 scaling solution. At the most basic level, a rollup L2 solution is responsible
for "rolling up" transactions by batching them before publishing them to the L1 chain, usually
through a network of **sequencers**. In theory, separate entities could assume the role of
sequencing transactions and publishing them. In practice, they are the same machine, but this will
likely change as rollups decentralize more. This mechanism could include thousands of transactions
in a single rollup.

!!!info "Layer Two Definition"
    Layer two (L2) networks are a key approach to blockchain scalability, off-loading the majority of computation from layer one (L1) networks. These solutions leverage the security of L1 to create an additional layer that is faster, reduces fees, and addresses platform-specific challenges. L2 solutions also focus on utilizing L1 blockspace efficiently and cost-effectively.

By adopting modular designs and re-using functionality, L2 networks enable the deployment of
scalable rollups for various virtual machine environments, including Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM),
Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and [Move-based](https://move-language.github.io/move/) systems. These
rollups settle back to Ethereum, ensuring a robust and secure foundation for diverse blockchain
ecosystems.

In this section, we explore the main differences in rollup technology between:

- Zero-knowledge rollups,
- Optimistic rollups, and
- Polkadot rollups (i.e., parachains).

Before diving into the differences between these rollup technologies, it is crucial to understand
the difference between non-interactive and interactive methods.

### Fraud Proofs vs. Validity Proofs

In the context of rollups, **interactive** and **non-interactive** methods are commonly used to
describe how the validity of transactions or state changes is established between the rollup layer
and the main blockchain (L1). These terms correspond closely to the mechanisms of **fraud proofs**
and **validity proofs**, which are the standard terminology.

An **interactive method** (associated with fraud proofs) involves a back-and-forth process to
validate transactions. A "prover" submits transaction data or state changes to L1, assuming it is
valid. A challenge mechanism is triggered if a dispute arises, requiring participants to provide
evidence (fraud proofs) to demonstrate invalidity. This process ensures correctness but introduces
latency due to dispute resolution periods, which can vary depending on the implementation. For
example, optimistic rollups often have challenge periods of several hours or even up to seven days.

A **non-interactive method** (associated with validity proofs) relies on cryptographic mechanisms,
such as SNARKs or STARKs, to validate transactions upfront. These proofs are generated off-chain and
submitted to L1 for verification without requiring dispute resolution. While these methods offer
near-instant finality, in theory, in practice delays are sometimes intentionally introduced as
safeguards. For instance, zkSync rollups may take up to a day to finalize transactions, not due to
technical limitations but as a precautionary measure while the technology matures and secures
high-value assets.

Below is a comparison of the two mechanisms:

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mechanism**      | Challenge-based system where disputes are resolved interactively.                                                                                               | Cryptographic proofs validate all transactions upfront, eliminating disputes.                                                                                                      |
| **Latency**        | Time to finality depends on challenge periods. Optimistic rollups often take hours or even days to finalize. Polkadot rollups reduce this to around 30 minutes. | Near-instant finality in theory. In practice, systems like zkSync can take up to a day to finalize, often due to artificial safeguards rather than inherent technical limitations. |
| **Security Basis** | Crypto-economic incentives and participant monitoring ensure validity.                                                                                          | Cryptographic guarantees ensure correctness upfront, reducing the need for external monitoring.                                                                                    |
| **Complexity**     | Simpler to implement but requires active monitoring and challenge resolution.                                                                                   | Computationally intensive and complex to build, especially for ZK systems.                                                                                                         |
| **Use Cases**      | Suitable for applications needing broad compatibility with existing systems and tolerating some latency for finality.                                           | Ideal for high-security applications or scenarios where upfront validation and near-instant finality are critical.                                                                 |

Both approaches address different trade-offs between scalability, security, latency, and
implementation complexity. Future innovations may blur the lines between these mechanisms, enabling
hybrid approaches such as non-interactive dispute systems.

### Zero-knowledge Rollups

Zero-knowledge rollups (commonly referred to as ZK rollups) are a non-interactive method that
utilizes cryptographic proofs, often in the form of SNARKs, to compute the validity of a particular
set of state changes. While the industry has adopted the term "ZK rollups," it is worth noting that
many implementations do not strictly involve zero-knowledge properties, as the proofs do not
necessarily conceal information. These rollups are better described simply as SNARK-based rollups,
but the term "ZK rollups" remains widely used.

In contrast to [optimistic rollups](#optimistic-rollups), which rely on fraud proofs and interactive
challenge mechanisms, ZK rollups rely entirely on cryptographic validation, with SNARKs providing
upfront proof of correctness. This approach allows ZK rollups to achieve significantly faster
finalization, as the validity proof ensures that all state transitions are correct without requiring
a challenge period.

However, ZK rollups face performance challenges due to the computational complexity involved in
proof generation and the difficulty of implementing these proofs in resource-constrained
environments. This complexity also makes achieving Turing completeness more challenging, which can
limit their generalizability in terms of blockspace usage. Despite these challenges, ZK rollups are
becoming increasingly viable for specialized applications. For example,
[Hyperbridge](./learn-bridges.md#bridge-comparison) is a SNARK-based rollup on Polkadot that acts as
a scalable, trustless bridge. It produces a single proof for multiple blockchains, which can be
instantly verified on Polkadot, demonstrating the potential of these rollups in niche use cases.

### Optimistic Rollups

Optimistic rollups are an interactive scaling method for L1 blockchains. They assume
_optimistically_ that every proposed transaction is valid by default.

In the case of mitigating potentially invalid transactions, optimistic rollups introduce a
_challenge period_ during which participants may challenge a suspect rollup. A fraud-proving scheme
can be in place to allow for several _fraud proofs_ to be submitted. Those proofs could make the
rollup valid or invalid. State changes may be disputed, resolved, or included during the challenge
period if no challenge is presented (and the required proofs are in place).

Optimistic rollups are often used in the Ethereum ecosystem. [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)
and [Arbitrium](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) are an example of optimistic EVM-based rollups.

### Polkadot Rollups

Polkadot Rollups work similarly to optimistic rollups. They are an interactive method with fraud
proof mechanism. Like optimistic rollups and zk rollups are secured by Ethereum, Polkadot rollups
are secured by the Polkadot Relay Chain. The checking and fraud-proof mechanics are natively
implemented in Polkadot. [Collators](./learn-collator.md) are in principle similar to sequencers, as
they pass data with a proof-of-validity (PoV) function for liveness and communication with the Relay
Chain.

Additionally, Polkadot operates as a _stateless client_ of its rollups, meaning the Relay Chain does
not maintain the entire state of each parachain. Instead, it verifies state transitions using PoV
blocks submitted by collators. This is analogous to _block witnesses_ in the Ethereum ecosystem,
which proves transaction validity without requiring full state storage. This design ensures
scalability by delegating state maintenance to rollups while enabling secure validation through
cryptographic proofs.

Polkadot rollups have the following main differences compared to optimistic rollups:

- Polkadot implements rollup functionality at the native level (i.e., without using L2 scaling
  solutions), allowing for shared security and scalability for each rollup through the
  [Parachains Protocol](./learn-parachains-protocol.md). Polkadot handles data coordination from
  parachains into an aggregated, representative state, similar to L2 rollups.
- If optimistic rollups are based on the assumption that all transactions are valid, **Polkadot
  rollups are "cynical" and always check the validity of transactions using a subset of the
  validators**. In case of disputes, an escalation effect involving more validators is triggered,
  and dispute resolution will end with the malicious actor being [slashed](./learn-offenses.md).
- Polkadot has multiple virtual cores that are made possible thanks to the Parachain Protocol, which
  allows execution sharding. Rollups access Polkadot by reserving time on those cores via
  [coretime](./learn-agile-coretime.md).

<sup>1</sup>There are efforts to allow native interoperability within rollup hubs, e.g., there will
be "better" interoperability within the OP Stack ecosystem than independent L2s.

<sup>2</sup>Optimistic rollups rely on Ethereum's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) for their
fraud-proof mechanisms and dispute resolution. However, rather than natively executing L2 opcodes,
the EVM interprets the logic of the rollup's virtual machine.

!!!info "Opcodes"
    An opcode (short for operation code) is the fundamental instruction used by a virtual machine to perform specific operations. In the context of the EVM, opcodes define low-level commands that execute computations, manage storage, and interact with smart contracts. Rollups process their opcodes, which the EVM interprets during dispute resolution and other operations.

While optimistic rollups often support EVM-compatible state transitions for seamless integration
with Ethereum and its ecosystem, they are not inherently restricted to EVM logic. Developers could
implement interpretation logic for other virtual machines, such as WASM or custom environments,
enabling optimistic rollups to support diverse computational frameworks. This flexibility expands
their potential beyond traditional EVM-based boundaries, contrasting with the perception that they
are strictly tied to Ethereum’s computational model.

<sup>3</sup>An escape hatch is a method by which users of a rollup can recover digital assets or
program state from a rollup when the operators (sequencers) are offline.

| **Security Model**          | Secured by Polkadot's relay validators and stake.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Secured by Ethereum’s base layer and rollup-specific fraud or validity proofs.          | Security ensured by Chainlink oracles and cryptographic proofs.                                |
| **Ease of Integration**     | Requires Substrate-based parachains and compliance with Polkadot protocols.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Requires rollups to align with Optimism’s OP stack architecture.                        | Blockchain-agnostic, integrates with any chain using CCIP libraries.                           |
| **Interoperability Speed**  | Near-instant, as Polkadot’s shared relay chain validates interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Relatively slower due to dependency on Layer 1 Ethereum finality and rollup delays.     | Fast, as it relies on Chainlink oracle nodes for data transmission.                            |
| **Use Cases**               | Native token transfers, contract execution (though Polkadot allows smart contract execution through XCM, it is almost impossible to use trustlessly in practice, as only straightforward calls can be passed without read access), and shared staking pools. | Bridging assets and state between rollups.                                              | Cross-chain DeFi, gaming, enterprise blockchain communication.                                 |
| **Prone to Centralization** | Low; while Polkadot's design enforces decentralization, it allows the decentralization of collators but does not mandate it, as there are chains with teams operating all collators.                                                                         | Optimism does not currently give a choice; sequencers must be centralized.              | Depends on the decentralization level of Chainlink's oracle network.                           |
| **Current Deployment**      | Actively deployed in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Early stage; foundational elements are live, expanding with OP stack rollups.           | Widely adopted across multiple chains in both testnet and mainnet.                             |
| **Key Strengths**           | Seamless, low-latency native communication within the ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Interoperability focused on Ethereum scalability and Layer 2 adoption.                  | Universal, chain-agnostic standard with flexible use cases.                                    |
| **Limitations**             | Limited to Polkadot-compatible parachains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Restricted to Ethereum and rollups using OP stack.                                      | It depends on the oracle network security and adoption rate.                                   |
