This document covers the basics of {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
accounts. See the [Advanced Account](./learn-account-advanced.md) page for more information about
accounts such as [account derivation](./learn-account-advanced.md#derivation-paths) and
[indices](./learn-account-advanced.md#indices). For a more in-depth explanation of the cryptography
behind {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} accounts, please see

## Account Address

An address is the public part of a {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
account. The private part is the key used to access this address. The public and private parts
together make up a {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} account. You can
think of the public address of your account like your mailbox and the private key like the key to
open that mailbox. Anybody can send mail to your mailbox, but only you can access them as only you
have access to its key. In the context of
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} accounts, anybody can send tokens to
your public address but only you can transact with them using your private key. That is why you
should keep your private key secret.

### Mnemonic and Address Generation

A valid account requires a private key that can sign on to one of the
[supported curves and signature schemes](../build/build-protocol-info.md#cryptography). Without a
private key an account cannot sign anything. In
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} there are some exceptions of accounts
that do not have private keys (i.e. key-less accounts). Such accounts are
[multi-signature accounts](./learn-account-multisig.md) and
[anonymous proxies](./learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy) that are not discussed here
and are meant for an advanced audience.

Most wallets generate a mnemonic phrase for users to back up their wallets and generate a private
key from the mnemonic. Not all wallets use the same algorithm to convert from mnemonic phrase to
private key, which affects the ability to use the same mnemonic phrase in multiple wallets. Wallets
that use different measures will arrive at a different set of addresses from the exact mnemonic
phrase.

:::danger Not all wallets use the same algorithm to convert from mnemonic phrase to private key

[Subkey](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/) and Polkadot-JS based
wallets use the BIP39 dictionary for mnemonic generation, but use the entropy byte array to generate
the private key, while full BIP39 wallets (like Ledger) use 2048 rounds of PBKDF2 on the mnemonic.
The same mnemonic may generate different private keys on other wallets due to the various
cryptographic algorithms used. See
[Substrate BIP39 Repo](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-bip39) for more information.

:::

A typical mnemonic phrase generated by
[the Subkey tool](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/) is shown below.

```
'caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very'
```

Its corresponding _private/public keypair_ is also shown.

```
Secret seed (Private key): 0x056a6a4e203766ffbea3146967ef25e9daf677b14dc6f6ed8919b1983c9bebbc
Public key (SS58): 5F3sa2TJAWMqDhXG6jhV4N8ko9SxwGy8TpaNS1repo5EYjQX
```

Polkadot default address format is the `MultiAddress` type. This means that the same mnemonic phrase
will generate public keys for different parachains. For more information see the
[Address Format](./learn-account-advanced.md#address-format) section on the
[Advanced Account](./learn-account-advanced.md) page.

## Account Balance Types

In {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} there are different types of
balance depending on the account activity. Different balance types indicate whether your balance can
be used for transfers, to pay fees, or must remain frozen and unused due to an on-chain requirement.
Below is an example that displays different balance types of a Kusama account in the
[Accounts tab of the Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) (note that the balance
types are the same for a Polkadot account).

![account_balance_types](../assets/account-balance-types.png)

- The **total** balance indicates the total number of tokens in the account. Note that this number
  does not necessarily correspond to the tokens you are allowed to transfer. In the example the
  total number of tokens in 0.6274 KSM. The **transferrable** balance indicates the number of tokens
  that are free to be transferred. This is calculated by subtracting the number of _locked_ and
  _reserved_ tokens from the total number of tokens. Locked funds correspond to tokens used in
  staking, governance, and vested transfers (see below). In the example, the transferrable balance
  is 0.0106 KSM.
- The **vested** balance indicates tokens that were sent to the account and that are released with a
  specific time schedule. The tokens are owned by the account but are _locked_ and become available
  for transfer after a specific number of blocks. In the example, the vested balance is 0.25 KSM.
- The **bonded** balance indicates the number of tokens that are _locked_ for on-chain participation
  to staking. In the example the bonded balance is 0.4 KSM.
- The **democracy** balance indicates the number of tokens that are _locked_ for on-chain
  participation to democracy (i.e. voting for referenda and council). In the example, the democracy
  balance is 0.4 KSM.
- The **redeemable** balance indicates the number of tokens that are ready to be unlocked to become
  transferrable again. Those tokens already went through the unbonding period. In this case, the
  redeemable balance is 0.1 KSM.
- The **locked** balance indicates the number of tokens that are frozen for on-chain participation
  to staking and democracy, or for vested transfers. **Locks do not stack**, which means that if you
  have different locks the total locked balance is not the addition of all single locks. Instead,
  **the biggest lock decides the total locked balance**. In the example, the locked balance is 0.55
  KSM because the biggest lock is on democracy (0.55 KSM).
- The **reserved** balance indicates the number of tokens that are frozen for on-chain activity
  other than staking, governance, and vested transfers. Such activity can be setting an identity or
  a proxy. Reserved funds are held due to on-chain requirements and can usually be freed by taking
  some on-chain action. For example, the "Identity" pallet reserves funds while an on-chain identity
  is registered, but by clearing the identity, you can unreserve the funds and make them free again.
  The same applies to proxies. The idea is that those actions require some network memory usage that
  is not given for free. In the example we created a governance proxy and the reserved funds for
  this are 0.0668 KSM.

### Query Account Data in Polkadot-JS

In the Polkadot-JS UI, you can also query account data under
[Developer > Chain state](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate). Under `selected state query`
choose the system pallet followed by `account(AccountId32): FrameSystemAccountInfo`, under `Option`
choose an account, and then click on the "+" button on the right.

![account_balance_types](../assets/AccountData-struct.png)

Account information include:

- `nonce`, the number of transactions the account sent.
- `consumers`, the number of other modules that currently depend on this account's existence. The
  account cannot be reaped until this is zero.
- `providers`, the number of other modules that allow this account to exist. The account may not be
  reaped until this and `sufficients` are both zero.
- `sufficients`, the number of modules that allow this account to exist for their own purposes. The
  account may not be reaped until this and `providers` are both zero.
- `data`, the additional data that belongs to this account. Used to store the balance(s) in a lot of
  chains.

More in-depth information about the above data can be found in the
[substrate code base](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/2e7fde832b77b242269b136f1c3b6fffef86f9b6/frame/system/src/lib.rs#LL767C1-L781C24).

The `AccountData` structure defines the balance types in Substrate. The three types of balances
include `free`, `reserved`, and `frozen`. The **usable** balance of the account is the amount that
is `free` minus any funds considered `frozen`, while the **total** balance of the account is the sum
of `free` and `reserved` funds. The `flags` describe extra information about the account.

More in-depth information about the above data can be found in the
[balances pallet in the Substrate code base](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/2e7fde832b77b242269b136f1c3b6fffef86f9b6/frame/balances/src/types.rs#LL95-L114).

### Unlocking Locks

:::info Locks do not stack!

The biggest lock decides the total amount of locked funds. See
[**this walk-through video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/LHgY7ds_bZ0) that will guide you in the
process of unlocking funds in the example above.

:::

In the example, we mentioned that the locked balance is 0.55 KSM because the biggest lock is on
democracy and is 0.55 KSM. As soon as the democracy lock is removed the next biggest lock is on
staking 0.5 KSM (bonded 0.4 KSM + redeemable 0.1 KSM). This means that the locked balance will be
0.5 KSM, and 0.05 KSM will be added to the transferrable balance. After redeeming the unbonded 0.1
KSM, the locked balance will be 0.4 KSM, and an additional 0.1 KSM will be added to the
transferrable balance. Now the biggest lock is still the bonded one. This means that even if we
remove the vested lock, the locked balance will still be 0.4 KSM and no tokens will be added to the
transferrable balance. To free those bonded tokens we will need to unbond them and wait for the
unbonding period to make them redeemable. If we remove the proxy the reserved funds will be
automatically added to the transferrable balance.

## Existential Deposit and Reaping

:::info

See [**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/Wg0pH05CC9Y) or visit
[**this support page**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168651-what-is-the-existential-deposit-)
for more information about existential deposit.

:::

When you generate an account (address), you only generate a _key_ that lets you access it. The
account does not exist yet on-chain. For that, it needs the existential deposit of
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={10000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>. :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={333333333} filter="humanReadable"/>. :kusama }}

Having an account go below the existential deposit causes that account to be _reaped_. The account
will be wiped from the blockchain's state to conserve space, along with any funds in that address.
You do not lose access to the reaped address - as long as you have your private key or recovery
phrase, you can still use the address - but it needs a top-up of another existential deposit to be
able to interact with the chain.

Transaction fees cannot cause an account to be reaped. Since fees are deducted from the account
before any other transaction logic, accounts with balances _equal to_ the existential deposit cannot
construct a valid transaction. Additional funds will need to be added to cover the transaction fees.

Here's another way to think about existential deposits. Ever notice those `Thumbs.db` files on
Windows or `.DS_Store` files on Mac? Those are junk; they serve no specific purpose other than
making previews a bit faster. If a folder is empty saved for such a file, you can remove the folder
to clear the junk off your hard drive. That does not mean you lose access to this folder forever -
you can always recreate it. You have the _key_, after all - you're the computer's owner. It just
means you want to keep your computer clean until you maybe end up needing this folder again and then
recreate it. Your address is like this folder - it gets removed from the chain when nothing is in it
but gets put back when it has the existential deposit.

## Account Identity

The [Identities pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/identity) built
into {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} allows users to attach on-chain
metadata to their accounts. Independent registrars can verify this metadata to provide
trustworthiness.

:::info

To learn more about how to set or release an identity, how to define sub-accounts, or how to become
a registrar, please read [this guide](learn-identity.md).

:::

## Proxy Accounts

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} comes with a generalized proxy
account system that allows users to keep keys in cold storage while proxies act on their behalf with
restricted (or unrestricted) functionality.

:::info

See the [proxies](learn-proxies.md) page for more information about proxies.

:::

## Multi-signature Accounts

Multi-signature accounts are accounts created from several standard accounts, pure proxies, and even
other multi-sig accounts.

:::info

See the [Multi-signature accounts page](./learn-account-multisig.md) for a full explanation about
multi-signature accounts, including their use-cases.
