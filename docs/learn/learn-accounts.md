This document covers the basics of {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
accounts. See the [Advanced Account](./learn-account-advanced.md) page for more information about
accounts such as [account derivation](./learn-account-advanced.md#derivation-paths) and
[indices](./learn-account-advanced.md#indices). For a more in-depth explanation of the cryptography
behind {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} accounts, please see
[the cryptography page](learn-cryptography.md).

## Account Address

An address is the public part of a {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
account. The private part is the key used to access this address. The public and private parts
together make up a {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} account. You can
think of the public address of your account like your mailbox and the private key like the key to
open that mailbox. Anybody can send mail to your mailbox, but only you can access them as only you
have access to its key. In the context of
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} accounts, anybody can send tokens to
your public address but only you can transact with them using your private key. That is why you
should keep your private key secret.

### Mnemonic and Address Generation

A user's account requires a private key that can sign on to one of the
[supported curves and signature schemes](../build/build-protocol-info.md#cryptography). Without a
private key an account cannot sign anything. In
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} there are some exceptions of accounts
that do not have private keys (i.e. key-less accounts). Such accounts are
[multi-signature accounts](./learn-account-multisig.md) and
[pure proxies](./learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy) that are not discussed here and
are meant for an advanced audience.

Most wallets generate a mnemonic phrase for users to back up their wallets and generate a private
key from the mnemonic. Not all wallets use the same algorithm to convert from mnemonic phrase to
private key, which affects the ability to use the same mnemonic phrase in multiple wallets. Wallets
that use different measures will arrive at a different set of addresses from the exact mnemonic
phrase.

:::danger Not all wallets use the same algorithm to convert from mnemonic phrase to private key

[Subkey](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/) and Polkadot-JS based
wallets use the BIP39 dictionary for mnemonic generation, but use the entropy byte array to generate
the private key, while full BIP39 wallets (like Ledger) use 2048 rounds of PBKDF2 on the mnemonic.
The same mnemonic may generate different private keys on other wallets due to the various
cryptographic algorithms used. See
[Substrate BIP39 Repo](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-bip39) for more information.

:::

A typical mnemonic phrase generated by
[the Subkey tool](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/) is shown below.

```
'caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very'
```

Its corresponding _private/public keypair_ is also shown.

```
Secret seed (Private key): 0x056a6a4e203766ffbea3146967ef25e9daf677b14dc6f6ed8919b1983c9bebbc
Public key (SS58): 5F3sa2TJAWMqDhXG6jhV4N8ko9SxwGy8TpaNS1repo5EYjQX
```

Polkadot default address format is the `MultiAddress` type. This means that the same mnemonic phrase
will generate public keys for different parachains. For more information see the
[Address Format](./learn-account-advanced.md#address-format) section on the
[Advanced Account](./learn-account-advanced.md) page.

## Account Balance Types

In {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} there are different types of
balance depending on the account activity. Different balance types indicate whether your balance can
be used for transfers, to pay fees, or must remain frozen and unused due to an on-chain requirement.
Below is an example that displays different balance types of a Kusama account in the
[Accounts tab of the Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) (note that the balance
types are the same for a Polkadot account).

![account_balance_types](../assets/account-balance-types.png)

- The **total** balance indicates the total number of tokens in the account. Note that this number
  does not necessarily correspond to the tokens you are allowed to transfer. In the example the
  total number of tokens in 0.6274 KSM. The **transferrable** balance indicates the number of tokens
  that are free to be transferred. This is calculated by subtracting the number of _locked_ and
  _reserved_ tokens from the total number of tokens. Locked funds correspond to tokens used in
  staking, governance, and vested transfers (see below). In the example, the transferrable balance
  is 0.0106 KSM.
- The **vested** balance indicates tokens that were sent to the account and that are released with a
  specific time schedule. The tokens are owned by the account but are _locked_ and become available
  for transfer after a specific number of blocks. In the example, the vested balance is 0.25 KSM.
- The **bonded** balance indicates the number of tokens that are _locked_ for on-chain participation
  to staking. In the example the bonded balance is 0.4 KSM.
- The **democracy** balance indicates the number of tokens that are _locked_ for on-chain
  participation to democracy (i.e. voting for referenda and council). In the example, the democracy
  balance is 0.4 KSM.
- The **redeemable** balance indicates the number of tokens that are ready to be unlocked to become
  transferrable again. Those tokens already went through the unbonding period. In this case, the
  redeemable balance is 0.1 KSM.
- The **locked** balance indicates the number of tokens that are frozen for on-chain participation
  to staking and democracy, or for vested transfers. **Locks do not stack**, which means that if you
  have different locks the total locked balance is not the addition of all single locks. Instead,
  **the biggest lock decides the total locked balance**. In the example, the locked balance is 0.55
  KSM because the biggest lock is on democracy (0.55 KSM).
- The **reserved** balance indicates the number of tokens that are frozen for on-chain activity
  other than staking, governance, and vested transfers. Such activity can be setting an identity or
  a proxy. Reserved funds are held due to on-chain requirements and can usually be freed by taking
  some on-chain action. For example, the "Identity" pallet reserves funds while an on-chain identity
  is registered, but by clearing the identity, you can unreserve the funds and make them free again.
  The same applies to proxies. The idea is that those actions require some network memory usage that
  is not given for free. In the example we created a governance proxy and the reserved funds for
  this are 0.0668 KSM.

## Existential Deposit and Reaping

:::info

See [**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/Wg0pH05CC9Y) or visit
[**this support page**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168651-what-is-the-existential-deposit-)
for more information about existential deposit.

:::

When you generate an account (address), you only generate a _key_ that lets you access it. The
account does not exist yet on-chain. For that, it needs the existential deposit of
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={10000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>. :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={333333333} filter="humanReadable"/>. :kusama }}

Having an account go below the existential deposit causes that account to be _reaped_. The account
will be wiped from the blockchain's state to conserve space, along with any funds in that address.
You do not lose access to the reaped address - as long as you have your private key or recovery
phrase, you can still use the address - but it needs a top-up of another existential deposit to be
able to interact with the chain.

Transaction fees cannot cause an account to be reaped. Since fees are deducted from the account
before any other transaction logic, accounts with balances _equal to_ the existential deposit cannot
construct a valid transaction. Additional funds will need to be added to cover the transaction fees.

Here's another way to think about existential deposits. Ever notice those `Thumbs.db` files on
Windows or `.DS_Store` files on Mac? Those are junk; they serve no specific purpose other than
making previews a bit faster. If a folder is empty saved for such a file, you can remove the folder
to clear the junk off your hard drive. That does not mean you lose access to this folder forever -
you can always recreate it. You have the _key_, after all - you're the computer's owner. It just
means you want to keep your computer clean until you maybe end up needing this folder again and then
recreate it. Your address is like this folder - it gets removed from the chain when nothing is in it
but gets put back when it has the existential deposit.

## Ways to Generate an Account

:::info Treasury-funded Wallets and Browser Extensions

If you are a general user, you are recommended to create accounts using any of the
[wallets and extensions](../general/wallets-and-extensions.md) funded by the Treasury or Grants. If
you are a power user or a developer, you can use
[Polkadot-JS Extension](../general/polkadotjs.md#polkadot-js-extension).

:::

When you create accounts using browser extensions like
[the Polkadot-JS extension](#polkadot-js-browser-extension), it stores your accounts in a private
vault and lets you clear your browser cache without fear. Remember to back up your seed phrase - if
you lose access to this computer or the extension somehow crashes beyond repair, the seed phrase
will come in handy. Alternatively, you can create accounts using the
[Polkadot-JS UI](#polkadot-js-ui), although this option is disabled by default. More info about the
Polkadot-JS UI can be found on [the dedicated page](../general/polkadotjs-ui.md).

Please note that all wallets that are connected to the internet are considered "hot wallets" that
are susceptible to a wide range of attacks, so it is recommended to use cold storage when dealing
with non-trivial amounts.

Current popular cold storage solutions within the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem include
[Ledger](../general/ledger.md) and [Polkadot Vault](../general/polkadot-vault.md). The latter keeps
your keys on an air-gapped mobile phone. However, it does require obtaining a dedicated Android or
iOS-compatible phone that you are comfortable using only for Polkadot Vault.

Besides the Polkadot-JS browser extension and the Polkadot-JS UI,
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} addresses can also be created with
the [Subkey tool](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/utils/subkey). Subkey is
intended for users comfortable using the command line and can seem intimidating, but it is quite
approachable. Follow the instructions in the
[Subkey documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/).

## Backing Up Accounts

Depending on what software you use to access your account, there are various ways to back up and
restore your account. It is a good idea to back your information up and keep it secure. In general,
as long as you know how you created your account and have the seed phrase
([mnemonic phrase](learn-accounts#portability)) or JSON file (and password) stored securely, you can
restore your account.
