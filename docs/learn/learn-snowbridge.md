Snowbridge by [Snowfork](https://snowfork.com/) is a general-purpose, trustless bridge between
Polkadot and Ethereum. It utilizes the [Bridge Hub system parachain](./learn-bridge-hub.md) to
establish a connection to its relayers, allowing for permissionless messaging between Ethereum and
Polkadot.

## Trustlessness in Snowbridge

Trustlessness here is defined in the sense that the users do not need to trust any particular
individuals or organizations, but rather only the mathematics, code, cryptography, and protocol. An
example of a system which implies a high level of trust **trust** would be that of a bridge which is
controlled via a multi-signature scheme, wherein you must trust the cosignatories.

Basic assumptions are always needed in principle when defining a trustless system, as a completely
trustless setup cannot always be guaranteed.

With Snowbridge, a sender can always run a
[relayer](https://docs.snowbridge.network/architecture/relayers) to ensure that their cross-chain
transaction is successful.

## Applications

Snowbridge currently supports
[two-way token transfers](https://docs.snowbridge.network/applications/token-transfers) between
Ethereum and Polkadot parachain.

## Accessing & Using Snowbridge

Snowbridge can be accessed through [the web app](https://app.snowbridge.network/), where you may
track [processing times of transactions,](https://app.snowbridge.network/status),
[recent transfers](https://app.snowbridge.network/history), and other information about the bridge's
overall status.

To create transfers, you may visit the [transfer page.](https://app.snowbridge.network/)
