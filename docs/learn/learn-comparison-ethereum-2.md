Polkadot is the first fully sharded production-grade blockchain protocol. The current protocol of
Ethereum does not implement sharding and it is the main focus of
[the next major upgrade](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq#What-is-Danksharding).
Similar to Polkadot and its parachains, Ethereum has goals of being a multi-sharded network. When a
network is **sharded**, this implies that it is capable of executing multiple (and often many) state
transitions in parallel in a scalable manner. One key difference is that Polkadot parachains are
heterogeneous shards while Ethereum will have homogeneous shards. In other words, each parachain can
have its own state transition logic whereas on Ethereum, all the shards use the same state
transition logic.

Both protocols are blockchains but serve fundamentally different roles in how they are utilized:

- Ethereum is a general-purpose blockchain that hosts the Ethereum Virtual Machine, an environment
  for executing smart contracts.
- Polkadot is a heterogeneous sharded, multi-chain protocol that hosts multiple chains and provides
  a way for them to partake in a shared security model. Polkadot acts as a **meta-protocol** that
  allows for multiple protocols to coexist and work together.

It's important to note that the "Ethereum" here refers to what was previously known as "Eth2" or
"Ethereum 2.0". For more concrete details regarding the subsequent iterations of Ethereum, please
refer to the [Ethereum Roadmap](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/).

It's relevant to mention that some upgrades may not be active for Ethereum but are described as a
part of this comparison to Polkadot. Some of these goals/upgrades may change to reflect the general
direction of Ethereum.

:::

## High-Level Comparison

At a high level, both protocols have fundamentally different goals, which are reflected by their
architecture:

- Ethereum is a general-purpose blockchain for **global coordination**. Ethereum is not specialized
  nor optimized for any particular application, rather its primary focus is the Ethereum Virtual
  Machine for executing smart contracts.
- Polkadot is a sharded blockchain that introduces shared security for each one of its shards, or
  **parachains**. Each shard is usually specialized towards a specific focus and optimized towards
  that goal. Polkadot provides shared security and consensus to these shards through the Polkadot
  relay chain.

Polkadot can't and does not directly run something like a virtual machine for smart contracts.
However, several of its parachains can (and do). Parachains on Polkadot can even run an EVM for
executing smart contracts written in Solidity, Ethereum's native smart contract language.

In the context of blockchain, "sharding" refers to the parallelization of state transition
(transaction) execution. The way Ethereum and Polkadot deal with scalability and sharding is quite
different.

## Scalability: Sharding vs. Danksharding

As part of Ethereum's roadmap, the previously dubbed "shard chains" have been forgone in favor of
rollup-based approach for scaling transaction throughput.
[**Danksharding**](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/) is how Ethereum plans to create a
scalable environment for an acclaimed >100,000 transactions per second. Danksharding was the chosen
alternative over "shard chains" and works by storing blobs.

Danksharding will allow for much more space to be utilized per block on Ethereum, where blobs of
data will be verifiable for an amount of time before being pruned from the network. These blobs will
have to be held for an amount of time, implying a level of data availability that validators must
have. This approach will enable data availability at layer one and further enable layer two
protocols on Ethereum to flourish.

In contrast, {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} is a purely sharded
network. It prioritizes data availability as an integral part of the block validation process.
Parallelized interactions between parachains, the **shards** of the Polkadot network, also take
advantage of this factor. Whereas Ethereum primarily focuses on making large amounts of data
available for validation for a portion of time, Polkadot's parallelization factor allows
verification to happen on the protocol level without needing a layer two solution.

:::note

The term "shards" is used here, but know that shards and parachains mean the same thing! Each
parachain represents a shard in the Polkadot network.

:::

On {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}, each shard hosts core logic. As
mentioned earlier, each shard (i.e., [parachain](learn-parachains.md)) has a unique state transition
function (sometimes called a **runtime**). Applications can exist either within a single shard or
across shards by composing logic to create [cross-consensus (XCM)](learn-xcm.md) interactions.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses WebAssembly
([Wasm](./learn-wasm.md)) as a "meta-protocol". A shard's state transition function can be abstract
as long as the validators on {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} can
execute it within a Wasm environment.

## Architectural Differences: Polkadot and Ethereum

As previously mentioned, Ethereum is a **general-purpose** virtual machine that can run sandboxed
programs written in Solidity, whereas Polkadot is a meta-protocol for other parachains to connect 
and interact with each other.

Ethereum operates as a single, homogeneous chain. Each Ethereum node is divided into two layers: the
**consensus** and **execution** layers. Each layer handles the block validation information, peer
discovery, and Proof-of-Stake of the Ethereum client.

Polkadot's primary component is the **relay chain**, which hosts heterogeneous **shards** called
parachains. The relay chain aggregates information from its shards, the parachains, where Polkadot
validators agree upon consensus and finality. In essence, one can look at Polkadot as a series of
**runtimes**, which are state transition functions used to describe parachains (shards), as well as
Polkadot itself. Like Ethereum, Polkadot clients abstract away many of their responsibilities into
various components built using Substrate.

### Forks, Upgrades, and Governance

Ethereum governance is done off-chain, where various stakeholders come to a consensus through some
medium other than the protocol itself. Upgrades on Ethereum will follow the standard hard-fork
procedure, requiring validators to upgrade their nodes to implement protocol changes.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses on-chain
[governance](./learn-polkadot-opengov.md) with a multicameral system. There are several avenues to
issue proposals, and all proposals ultimately pass through a public referendum, where the majority
of tokens can always control the outcome.
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses
[adaptive quorum biasing](./learn-governance.md#adaptive-quorum-biasing) to set the passing
threshold for low-turnout referenda. Referenda can cover various topics, including fund allocation
from an on-chain [Treasury](./learn-treasury.md) or modifying the underlying runtime code of the
chain. Decisions get enacted on-chain and are binding and autonomous.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} can enact chain upgrades and
successful proposals using the Wasm meta-protocol without a hard fork. Anything within the state
transition function, the transaction queue, or off-chain workers can be upgraded without forking the
chain.

### Consensus and Finalization

Ethereum and {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} use hybrid consensus
models where block production and finality have their protocols. The finality protocols - Casper FFG
for Ethereum and [GRANDPA](./learn-consensus.md#finality-gadget-grandpa) for
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} - are both GHOST-based and can both
finalize batches of blocks in one round. For block production, both protocols use slot-based
protocols that randomly assign validators to a slot and provide a fork choice rule for unfinalized
blocks - RandDAO/LMD for Ethereum and [BABE](./learn-consensus.md#badass-babe-sassafras) for
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}.

There are two main differences between Ethereum and
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} consensus:

1.  Ethereum finalizes batches of blocks according to periods called "epochs". The current plan is
    to have 32 blocks per epoch and finalize them all in one round. With a predicted block time of
    12 seconds, the expected time to finality is 6 minutes (12 minutes maximum). See
    [Ethereum 2 Block Time](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/676e216/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#time-parameters)
    for more information.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot's :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama's :kusama }} finality protocol, GRANDPA,
finalizes batches of blocks based on
[availability and validity checks](./learn-parachains-protocol.md#availability-and-unavailability-phase)
that happen as the proposed chain grows. The time to finality varies with the number of checks that
need to be performed (and invalidity reports cause the protocol to require extra checks). The
expected time to finality is 12-60 seconds.

2.  Ethereum requires many validators per shard to provide strong validity guarantees while
    {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} can provide stronger guarantees
    with fewer validators per shard. {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
    achieves this by making validators distribute an
    [erasure coding](./learn-parachains-protocol.md#erasure-codes) to all validators in the system,
    such that anyone - not only the shard's validators - can reconstruct a parachain's block and
    test its validity. The random parachain-validator assignments and secondary checks are
    
    
    
    performed by randomly selected validators making it less likely for the small set of validators 
    on each parachain to collude.

### Staking Mechanics

Ethereum is a proof-of-stake network that requires 32 ETH to stake for each validator instance.
Validators run a primary Beacon Chain node and multiple validator clients - one for each 32 ETH.
These validators get assigned to "committees," randomly selected groups to validate shards in the
network. Ethereum relies on having a large validator set to provide availability and validity
guarantees: They need at least 111 validators per shard to run the network and 256 validators per
shard to finalize all shards within one epoch. With 64 shards, that's 16_384 validators (given 256
validators per shard). See
[Ethereum Economics](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-economics/) and
[Eth2 shard chain simplification proposal](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HkiULaluS) for more
information.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} can provide strong finality and
availability guarantees with much fewer validators. It uses
[Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](learn-staking.md) to select validators from a smaller set, letting
smaller holders nominate validators to run infrastructure while still claiming the rewards of the
system without running a node of their own.
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} needs about ten validators for each
parachain in the network.

### Interoperability and Message Passing

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses
[Cross-Consensus Message Passing Format (XCM)](./learn-xcm.md) for parachains to send arbitrary
messages to each other. Parachains open connections with each other and can send messages via their
established channels. Given that [collators](./learn-collator.md) will need to be full nodes of the
relay chain as well, they will be connected and can relay messages from parachain A to parachain B.

Messages do not pass through the relay chain. Only validity proofs and channel operations do (open,
close, etc.). This enhances scalability by keeping data on the edges of the system.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} will add a protocol called
[SPREE](learn-spree.md) that provides shared logic for cross-chain messages. Messages sent with
SPREE carries additional guarantees about provenance and interpretation by the receiving chain.

## DApp Support and Development

Ethereum mainly supports a form of smart contract development using Solidity. These contracts are
immutable, and cannot be changed once published on-chain.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} supports smart contracts through
parachains, usually using the [ink! smart contract language](https://use.ink/). On Ethereum, smart
contracts can call each other; however, they are fixed on-chain to the domain of Ethereum. On
Polkadot, smart contracts can call each other in the same parachain and across parachains.

On Polkadot, developers have the option of either using smart contracts, calling extrinsics from
pallets that modify the chain's state in some particular way or merely use Polkadot's RPC to
directly retrieve and act on-chain information. DApps on Polkadot are often composed of these
multiple components working together to modify, retrieve, and watch state changes live as they
happen.

## Conclusion

Ethereum and {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} both use a sharded
model. Danksharding plans to utilize a rollup-centric approach by focusing on data availability. The
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem is secured by a main chain,
called the "relay chain," which in turn manages and connects its shards ("parachains/parathreads")
into a single, homogenous solution.

The primary differences between the two protocols are:

- All shards in Ethereum represent the same state transitions, while
  {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} lets shards have an abstract state
  transition function implementation.
- Governance processes in Ethereum are planned to be off-chain and thus require coordination for a
  hard fork to enact governance decisions. In contrast, in
  {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} the decisions are on-chain and
  enacted autonomously via forkless upgrades.
- Validator selection mechanisms differ as
  {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} can provide strong availability and
  validity guarantees with fewer validators per shard.
