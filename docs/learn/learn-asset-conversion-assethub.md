Asset conversion is a simple AMM (Automated Market Maker) based on
[Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) logic, deployed as a
[pallet on Polkadot AssetHub](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/asset-conversion).
In the AMM model the prices of tokens are determined by a mathematical formula based on the ratio of
tokens in a liquidity pool, unlike traditional exchanges that use an order book. This will be a
“trustless” DEX, which is controlled through Polkadot OpenGov.

:::note

The asset pairs of the liquidity pools of AssetHub will always contain
{{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }} as one of the asets. Provision of liquidity
for pools with arbitrary asset pairs is not allowed.

:::

Asset Conversion on Asset Hub enables fee payment in any asset, given it has a liquidity pool, such
that the fee handler (in this case, a Collator) only receives the native asset
({{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }} ).

Asset Conversion pallet allows you to:

- [create a liquidity pool](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/latest/pallet_asset_conversion/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.create_pool)
  with {{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }} and an asset
- [provide the liquidity](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/latest/pallet_asset_conversion/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.add_liquidity)
  and receive back an LP token
- [exchange the LP token back to assets](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/latest/pallet_asset_conversion/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.remove_liquidity)
- [swap assets if there is a pool created](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/latest/pallet_asset_conversion/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.swap_exact_tokens_for_tokens)
- [query for an exchange price](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/latest/pallet_asset_conversion/trait.AssetConversionApi.html#method.quote_price_exact_tokens_for_tokens)
  via a runtime call endpoint
- [query the size of a liquidity pool](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/latest/pallet_asset_conversion/trait.AssetConversionApi.html#method.get_reserves).

## Fee Payment in Any Asset - Wallets

Without Asset Conversion pallet, only DOT and sufficient assets can be used for paying transaction
fees. With the Asset Conversion pallet deployed, it is possible for Wallets to enable users to pay
transaction fees through any arbitrary asset that has been made available in pools with either DOT
or sufficient assets. More specifically, this functionality is enabled through
[Asset Conversion Transaction Payment Pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/cdc8d197e6d487ef54f7e16767b5c1ab041c8b10/substrate/frame/transaction-payment/asset-conversion-tx-payment),
allowing runtimes that include it to pay for transactions in assets other than the native token of
the chain.

:::caution Handling Pools with Low Liquidity

The wallets and UIs should ensure that the user is prompted with the necessary warnings, such that
they do not accidentally spend all the funds to perform a swap on a pool with no or low liquidity.

## Fee Payment in Any Asset - Parachains

Parachains can pay for their XCM execution fees in any asset that has a liquidity pool on AssetHub.

## Creation of Pools with Foreign Assets - Parachains

Assets pallet uses XCM MultiLocations to represent assets, and their corresponding origins to
control them.

One of the pain points of integrating parachain tokens natively on wallets and exchanges is that
they require running individual parachain infrastructure like full nodes to process deposits, and
require additional code to handle withdrawals because they need to be able to construct and
broadcast transactions on each individual parachain. These parachains could use different balances
pallets or order them differently. When Polkadot hosts hundreds of parachains (and possibly
thousands of threads), this becomes a huge burden in terms of network support. This is in contrast
to for example adding support for an additional ERC20 token; the marginal effort is very small since
an Ethereum node already serves all the data they need.

With support for these assets on AssetHub, exchanges/custodians could just monitor one chain for
deposits (applications and UIs would need to give the option to transfer to AssetHub). For
withdrawals, users could choose to withdraw to their address on AssetHub. There are two user
experience bonuses here:

- For the exchange/custodian, they only need to transact on one parachain and can access every other
  without any infrastructure lift.
- For the user, they never actually need to “see” AssetHub. It’s entirely abstracted away behind
  either the parachain wallet/application or the exchange/custodian.
