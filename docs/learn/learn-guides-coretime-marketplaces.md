!!!info
    If you aren't sure what Agile Coretime is, be sure to read the [introduction](./learn-agile-coretime.md), [terminology](./learn-agile-coretime.md#agile-coretime-terminology), and [FAQ](./learn-agile-coretime.md#agile-coretime-faq).

The tutorials in this document utilize:

- [CoreHub on RegionX](https://app.regionx.tech/), a user interface for purchasing and managing
  Coretime regions.

- [Lastic](https://www.lastic.xyz/), a Coretime marketplace user interface.

!!!caution Both RegionX and Lastic are under active development and are released only for testing purposes.

RegionX allows for purchasing core with accounts hosted on wallets like Subwallet, Talisman, Nova
Wallet and Polkadot-JS Extension. Select the account to be used for the coretime purchase (displayed
on top right) and ensure that both the relay chain and coretime chain are connected (displayed on
bottom left). Then, click on the purchase button to sign and broadcast the transaction.
