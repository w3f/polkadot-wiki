## Polkadot OpenGov Terminology and Parameters

The important parameters to be aware of when voting using the Referenda module are as follows:

**Origin** - Each origin has a fixed set of privileges. When making a proposal, it is important to
choose the origin that has the privilege to execute the referenda.

**Track** - Each track has its own dispatch origin and a preset configuration that governs the
voting process and parameters.

**Submission Deposit** - The minimum amount to be used as a (refundable) deposit to submit a public
referendum proposal.

**Prepare Period** - The minimum time the referendum needs to wait before it can progress to the
next phase after submission. Voting is enabled, but the votes do not count toward the outcome of the
referendum yet.

**Decision Deposit** - This deposit is required for a referendum to progress to the decision phase
after the end of prepare period.

**Decision Period** - Amount of time a decision may take to be approved to move to the confirming
period. If the proposal is not approved by the end of the decision period, it gets rejected.

**Max Deciding** - The maximum number of referenda that can be in the decision period of a track all
at once.

**Conviction**: A multiplier to increase voting power.

**Approval**: the share of the approval vote-weight after adjustments for conviction against the
total number of vote-weight for both approval and rejection

**Support**: The total number of votes in approval (ignoring adjustments for conviction) compared to
the total possible amount of votes that could be made in the system. Support also takes into account
abstained votes.

**Min Approval** - The threshold of approval (along with the min support) needed for a proposal to
meet the requirements of the confirm period.

**Min Support** - The threshold of support (along with the min approval) needed for a proposal to
meet the requirements of the confirm period.

**Confirmation Period** - The total time the referenda must meet both the min approval and support
criteria during the decision period in order to pass and enter the enactment period.

**Min Enactment Period** - Minimum time that an approved proposal must be in the dispatch queue
after approval. The proposer has the option to set the enactment period to be of any value greater
than the min enactment period.

For every referendum in each of these tracks, the Polkadot-JS UI displays interactive graphs of the
support and approval.

### Root

The origin with the highest level of privileges. This track requires extremely high levels of
approval and support for early passing. The prepare and enactment periods are also large. For
instance, a referendum proposed in this track needs to amass
{{ polkadot: 48.2% :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  46.8%  :kusama }} support (total network issuance) by the
end of the first day with over {{ polkadot: 93.5% :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  88%  :kusama }} approval
to be considered to be part of the confirm period. The support curve drops linearly to 25% by the
end of day {{ polkadot: 14 :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  7  :kusama }} and almost to 0% by the end of day
{{ polkadot: 28 :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  14  :kusama }}. This ensures that the token holders receive
ample time to vote on the proposal during the decision period.

{{ kusama: <Chart title="" type="line" dataId="Root" network="Kusama" maxX="336" maxY="100" /> :kusama }}

### Whitelisted Caller

Origin commanded by the [Fellowship](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#the-technical-fellowship)
whitelist some hash of a call and allow the call to be dispatched with the root origin (after the
referendum passes). This track allows for a shorter voting turnaround, safe in the knowledge through
an open and transparent process for time-critical proposals. For instance, a referendum proposed in
this track needs to amass {{ polkadot: 20% :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  14%  :kusama }} support (much
lesser than the root) by the end of the first day with over
{{ polkadot: 93.5% :polkadot }}{{ kusama:  88%  :kusama }} approval to be considered to be part of
the confirm period.
