Welcome to the learner's section of the Polkadot Wiki.

Whether you are a developer or someone just getting started with
blockchain, here you will learn how the Polkadot network works from the ground up - from accounts to the protocols that power the Polkadot network.

There are a series of video tutorials which are also provided, which you may
[find here](./learn-video-tutorials.md).

## The Basics: DOT, Accounts, & Staking
