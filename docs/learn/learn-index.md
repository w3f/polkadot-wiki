Welcome to the learner's section of the Polkadot Wiki.

Whether you are a developer or someone just getting started with blockchain, here you will learn how
the Polkadot network works from the ground up - from accounts to the protocols that power the
Polkadot network.

If you want to learn more about how to use different tools on Polkadot, you can visit the
