:::info Disclaimer

Various parachains or applications living on top of Polkadot might add various economic schemes and
include slashes, but they are unrelated to the slashes described here as they only refer to the
staked tokens via [Nominated Proof-of-Stake](./learn-staking.md#nominated-proof-of-stake-npos).

Polkadot is a public permissionless network. As such, it has a mechanism to disincentivize offenses
and incentivize good behavior. Below, you can find a summary of punishments for specific offenses:

## Offenses

:::info Learn more about the parachain protocol

To better understand the terminology used for offenses, it is recommended to get familiar with the
[parachain protocol](./learn-parachains-protocol.md).

:::

On Polkadot, there are six main validator offenses as shown below.

- **Backing Invalid:** A para-validator is backing an invalid block.
- **ForInvalid Vote:** A validator (secondary checker) votes in favor of an invalid block.
- **AgainstValid Vote:** A validator (secondary checker) is voting against a valid block (and
  wasting network resources).
- **Equivocation:** A validator produces two or more of the same block or vote.
  - GRANDPA and BEEFY Equivocation: A validator signs two or more votes in the same round on
    different chains.
  - BABE Equivocation: A validator produces two or more blocks on the relay chain in the same time
    slot.
- **Double Seconded Equivocation:** Within a backing group of 5 para-validators, at most 5 backed
  parablocks are possible. Each parablock requires exactly one seconded and at least two more valid
  votes from the five potential backers. This makes an upper bound on the number of parablocks the
  system has to deal with while still allowing some choice for relay chain block authors. Backers
  must decide which parablock to second, and they cannot second another. If another seconding vote
  is found, they will be punished (somewhat lightly as of now, but there is little to gain from
  this). All of this is made slightly more complicated with
  [asynchronous backing](./learn-async-backing.md) as it is no longer one candidate per relay chain
  block as backers can back blocks "into the future" optimistically. See
  [this page](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/book/node/backing/statement-distribution.html#seconding-limit)
  for more information.
- **Seconded + Valid Equivocation:** This happens when a malicious node first seconds something
  (takes absolute responsibility for it), and then only pretends to be someone who just said it is
  correct after someone else takes responsibility. That is a straight-up lie (equivocation). A node
  could use that tactic to escape responsibility, but once the system notices the two conflicting
  votes, the offense is reported.

### Equivocation (Conflicting Statements)

Equivocation occurs when a validator produces statements that conflict with each other.

For instance, as a block author appointed by BABE, only a single block should be authored for the
given slot, and if two or more are authored, they are in conflict with each other. This would be a
BABE Equivocation Offence.

In BEEFY & GRANDPA validators are expected to cast a single vote for the block they believe is the
best, but if they are found with two or more votes for different blocks, it means they tried to
confuse the network with conflicting statements and when found out this will be a BEEFY/GRANDPA
Equivocation Offense.

Equivocations usually occur when duplicate signing keys reside on the validator host. If keys are
never duplicated, the probability of an honest equivocation slash decreases to near 0.

## Punishments

On Polkadot, offenses to the network can be punished depending on their severity. There are three
main punishments: slashing, disabling, and reputation changes.

### Slashing

**Slashing** will happen if a validator misbehaves in the network. They and their nominators will
get slashed by losing a percentage of their staked tokens, from as little as 0.01% up to 100%.

Any slashed token will be added to the [Treasury](./archive/learn-treasury.md). The rationale for
this (rather than burning or distributing them as rewards) is that slashes may be reverted by simply
paying out from the Treasury. This would be useful in situations such as faulty slashes. In the case
of legitimate slashing, tokens are moved away from malicious validators to those building the
ecosystem through the normal Treasury process.

Slashing only occurs for active validations for a given nominator, and slashes are not mitigated by
having other inactive or waiting nominations. They are also not mitigated by the validator operator
running separate nodes; each node is considered its own entity for slashing purposes.

:::info Multiple Active Nominations

In rare instances, with very large bonds, a nominator may actively nominate several validators in a
single era. In this case, the slash is proportionate to the amount staked to that specific
validator. Note that you cannot control the percentage of stake allocated to each validator or
choose who your active validator will be (except in the trivial case of nominating a single
validator). Staking allocations are controlled by the [Phragmén algorithm](learn-phragmen.md).

:::

Once a validator gets slashed, it goes into the state as an "unapplied slash". You can check this
via
[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/staking/slashes).
The UI shows it per validator, followed by all the affected nominators and the amounts. While
unapplied, a governance proposal can be made to reverse it during a 27-day grace period, after which
the slashes are applied.

A slash may occur under the circumstances below:

1.  Equivocations – A slash of 0.01% is applied with as little as a single evocation. The slashed
    amount increases to 100% incrementally as more validators also equivocate.
2.  Disputes – This may result from a validator trying to represent the contents of a block falsely
    . Slashing penalties of 100% may apply.

#### Slash for Equivocation

The following levels of offense are
[defined](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/slashing/amounts). However, these
particular levels are not implemented or referred to in the code or the system; they are meant as
guidelines for different levels of severity for offenses.

- Level 1: Isolated equivocation slashes a minimal amount of the stake.
- Level 2: Misconducts unlikely to be accidental but do not harm the network's security to any large
  extent. Examples include concurrent equivocation or isolated cases of unjustified voting in
  [GRANDPA](learn-consensus.md). Slashes a moderately small amount of the stake.
- Level 3: misconduct that poses severe security or monetary risk to the system or mass collusion.
  Slashes all or most of the stake behind the validator.

The following are scenarios that build towards slashes under equivocation:

1.  Cloning a server, i.e., copying all contents when migrating to new hardware. This action should
    be avoided. If an image is desired, it should be taken before keys are generated.
2.  High Availability (HA) Systems – Equivocation can occur if there are any concurrent operations,
    either when a failed server restarts or if a false positive event results in both servers being
    online simultaneously. HA systems are to be treated with extreme caution and are not advised.
3.  The keystore folder is copied when attempting to copy a database from one instance to another.  
    It is important to note that equivocation slashes occur with a single incident. This can happen
    if duplicated keystores are used for only a few seconds. A slash can result in losing nominators
    and funds, removal from the [Decentralized Nodes program](https://nodes.web3.foundation/), and
    reputational damage.

See the next section to understand how slash amounts for equivocations are calculated. If you want
to know more details about slashing, please look at our
[research page](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/security/slashing/amounts).

#### Slash Calculation for Equivocation

GRANDPA, BABE, and BEEFY equivocation use the same formula for calculating the slashing penalty:

    Let x = offenders, n = total number of validators in the active set

    min((3 * x / n )^2, 1)

For example, assume that there are 100 validators in the active set, and one equivocates in a slot
(for our purposes, it does not matter whether it was a BABE or GRANDPA equivocation). This is
unlikely to be an attack on the network but much more likely to be a misconfiguration of a
validator. The penalty would be min(3 \* 1 / 100)^2, 1) = 0.0009, or a 0.09% slash for that
validator (i.e., the stake held by the validator and its nominators).

Now, assume that a group is running several validators, and they all have an issue in the same slot.
The penalty would be min((3 \* 5 / 100)^2, 1) = 0.0225, or a 2.25% slash. If 20 validators
equivocate, this is a much more serious offense, possibly indicating a coordinated attack on the
network. So, the slash will be much greater - min((3 \* 20 / 100)^2, 1) = 0.36, or a 36% slash on
all these validators and their nominators. All slashed validators will also be chilled.

The example above shows the risk of nominating or running many validators in the active set. While
rewards grow linearly (two validators will get you approximately twice as many staking rewards as
one) slashing grows exponentially. A single validator equivocating causes a 0.09% slash, and two
validators equivocating does not cause a 0.09 \* 2 = 0.18% slash, but rather a 0.36% slash - 4x as
much as the single validator.

Validators may run their nodes on multiple machines to ensure they can still perform validation work
if one of their nodes goes down. Still, validator operators should be cautious when setting these
up. Equivocation is possible if they do not have good coordination in managing signing machines.

#### Good Practices to Avoid Slashing

The following are advised to node operators to ensure that they obtain pristine binaries or source
code and to ensure the security of their node:

1.  Always download either source files or binaries from the official Parity repository
2.  Verify the hash of downloaded files.
3.  Use the W3F secure validator setup or adhere to its principles
4.  Ensure essential security items are checked, use a firewall, manage user access, use SSH
    certificates
5.  Avoid using your server as a general-purpose system. Hosting a validator on your workstation or
    one that hosts other services increases the risk of maleficence.

Below are some examples of small equivocations that happened in the past.

| Kusama   | 3995 | Small Equivocation | The validator noticed several errors, after which the client crashed, and a slash was applied. The validator recorded all events and opened GitHub issues to allow for technical opinions to be shared. Details can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1733).                                                | The validator requested to cancel the slash. The council approved the request as they believed the error was not operator-related. |

#### Slashing Across Eras

There are three main difficulties to account for with slashing in NPoS:

- A nominator can nominate multiple validators and be slashed via any of them.
- Until slashed, the stake is reused from era to era. Nominating with N coins for E eras in a row
  does not mean you have N\*E coins to be slashed - you've only ever had N.
- Slashable offenses can be found after the fact and out of order.

To balance this, the system applies only the maximum slash a participant can receive in a given time
period rather than the sum. This ensures protection from overslashing.

### Disabling

**Disabling** stops validators from performing specific actions after they have committed an
offense. Disabling is further divided into:

- On-chain disabling lasts for a whole era and stops validators from block authoring, backing, and
  initiating a dispute.
- Off-chain disabling lasts for a session, is caused by losing a dispute, and stops validators from
  initiating a dispute.

Off-chain disabling is always a lower priority than on-chain disabling. Off-chain disabling
prioritizes disabling first backers and then approval checkers.

### Reputation Changes

Some minor offenses often connected to spamming are only punished by Networking Reputation Changes.
When validators connect to each other, they use a reputation metric for each of their peers. If our
peers provide valuable data and behave appropriately, the system adds reputation; if they provide us
with faulty or spam data, the system reduces their reputation. A validator can lose enough
reputation so that the peers will temporarily close their channels. This helps in fighting against
DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. The consequences of closing channels may vary. In general,
performing validator tasks under reduced reputation will be harder, resulting in lower validator
rewards.
