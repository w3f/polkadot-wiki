{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses a sophisticated governance 
mechanism that allows it to evolve gracefully overtime at the ultimate behest of its assembled stakeholders. 
The stated goal is to ensure that the majority of the stake can always command the network.

:speech_balloon: **Please be advised: The contents in this guide are subject to change as per the recent efforts to
modify Polkadot Governance. See the following [pull request](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10195) 
for more details**.

To do this, the network brings together various novel mechanisms, including an amorphous state-transition
function stored on-chain and defined in a platform-neutral intermediate language (i.e.
[WebAssembly](learn-wasm.md)) and several on-chain voting mechanisms such as referenda with adaptive
super-majority thresholds and batch approval voting. 

All changes to the protocol must be agreed upon by stake-weighted referenda.

## Mechanism

To make any changes to the network, the idea is to compose active token holders and the council
together to administrate a network upgrade decision. No matter whether the proposal is proposed by
the public (token holders) or the council, it finally will have to go through a referendum to let
all holders, weighted by stake, make the decision.

To better understand how the council is formed, please read [this section](#council).

## Referenda

Referenda are simple, inclusive, stake-based voting schemes. Each referendum has a specific
*proposal* associated with it that takes the form of a privileged function call in the runtime (that
includes the most powerful call: `set_code`, which can switch out the entire code of the runtime,
achieving what would otherwise require a "hard fork").

Referenda are discrete events, have a fixed period where voting happens, and then are tallied and
the function call is made if the vote is approved. Referenda are always binary; your only options in
voting are "aye", "nay", or abstaining entirely.

Referenda can be started in one of several ways:

- Publicly submitted proposals;
- Proposals submitted by the council, either through a majority or unanimously;
- Proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum;
- Emergency proposals submitted by the Technical Committee and approved by the Council.

All referenda have an *enactment delay* associated with them. This is the period between the
referendum ending and, assuming the proposal was approved, the changes being enacted. 

Referenda is considered *baked* if it is closed and tallied. Again, assuming the proposal was 
approved, it would be scheduled for enactment. Referenda is considered *unbaked* if is pending 
an outcome, i.e. being voted on.

For the first
two ways that a referendum is launched, this is a fixed time of 
{{ polkadot: 28 days :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 8 days :kusama }}. For the third type, it can be set as 
desired. Emergency proposals deal with major problems with the network that need to be "fast-tracked". 
These will have a shorter enactment time.

### Proposing a Referendum

#### Public Referenda

Anyone can propose a referendum by depositing the minimum amount of tokens for a certain period
(number of blocks). If someone agrees with the proposal, they may deposit the same amount of tokens
to support it - this action is called *seconding*. The proposal with the highest amount of bonded
support will be selected to be a referendum in the next voting cycle.

Note that this may be different from the absolute number of seconds; for instance, three accounts
bonding {{ polkadot: 20 DOT each would "outweigh" ten accounts bonding a 
single DOT each :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 3 KSM each would "outweigh" six accounts bonding 0.5 KSM each }}. 

The bonded tokens will be released once the proposal is tabled (that is, brought to a vote).

There can be a maximum of 100 public proposals in the proposal queue.

#### Council Referenda

Unanimous Council - When all members of the council agree on a proposal, it can be moved to a
referendum. This referendum will have a negative turnout bias (that is, the smaller the amount of
stake voting, the smaller the amount necessary for it to pass - see "Adaptive Quorum Biasing",
below).

Majority Council - When agreement from only a simple majority of council members occurs, the
referendum can also be voted upon, but it will be majority-carries (51% wins).

There can only be one active referendum at any given time, except when there is also an emergency
referendum in progress.

#### Voting Timetable

Every {{ polkadot: 28 days :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 7 days :kusama }}, a new referendum will come up for 
a vote, assuming there is at least one proposal in one of the queues. There is a queue for Council-approved 
proposals and a queue for publicly submitted proposals. The referendum to be voted upon alternates between 
the top proposal in the two queues.

The "top" proposal is determined by the amount of stake bonded behind it. If the given queue whose
turn it is to create a referendum that has no proposals (is empty), and proposals are waiting in the
other queue, the top proposal in the other queue will become a referendum.

Multiple referenda cannot be voted upon in the same period, excluding emergency referenda. An
emergency referendum occurring at the same time as a regular referendum (either public- or
council-proposed) is the only time that multiple referenda will be able to be voted on at once.

#### Voting on a referendum

To vote, a voter generally must lock their tokens up for at least the enactment delay period beyond
the end of the referendum. This is in order to ensure that some minimal economic buy-in to the
result is needed and to dissuade vote selling.

It is possible to vote without locking at all, but your vote is worth a small fraction of a normal
vote, given your stake. At the same time, holding only a small amount of tokens does not mean that
the holder cannot influence the referendum result, thanks to time-locking. You can read more about
this at [Voluntary Locking](#voluntary-locking).

> To learn more about voting on referenda, please check out our
> [technical explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkbhhlsezGA&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8&index=31&ab_channel=Polkadot).


Example:

Peter: Votes `No` with {{ polkadot: 10 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 1 KSM :kusama }} for 
a 128 week lock period  => {{ polkadot: 10 x 6 = 60 Votes :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 1 x 6 = 6 Votes :kusama }}

Logan: Votes `Yes` with {{ polkadot: 20 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 2 KSM :kusama }} for 
a 4 week lock period => {{ polkadot: 20 x 1 = 20 Votes :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 2 x 1 = 2 Votes :kusama }}

Kevin: Votes `Yes` with {{ polkadot: 15 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 1.5 KSM :kusama }} for 
a 8 week lock period => {{ polkadot: 15 x 2 = 30 Votes :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 1.5 x 2 = 3 Votes :kusama }}

Even though combined both Logan and Kevin vote with more 
{{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }} than Peter, the lock period for both 
of them is less than Peter, leading to their voting power counting as less.

#### Tallying

Depending on which entity proposed the proposal and whether all council members voted yes, there are
three different scenarios. We can use the following table for reference.

|          **Entity**          |                   **Metric**                   |
| :--------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|            Public            | Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve) |
| Council (Complete agreement) | Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against) |
| Council (Majority agreement) |                Simple Majority                 |

Also, we need the following information and apply one of the formulas listed below to calculate the
voting result. For example, let's use the public proposal as an example, so the
`Super-Majority Approve` formula will be applied. There is no strict quorum, but the super-majority
required increases with lower turnout.

```
approve - the number of aye votes

against - the number of nay votes

turnout - the total number of voting tokens (does not include conviction)

electorate - the total number of tokens issued in the network
```

##### Super-Majority Approve

A `positive turnout bias`, whereby a heavy super-majority of aye votes is required to carry at low
turnouts, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority-carries as below.

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;{against&space;\over&space;\sqrt{turnout}}&space;<&space;{approve&space;\over&space;\sqrt{electorate}})

##### Super-Majority Against

A `negative turnout bias`, whereby a heavy super-majority of nay votes is required to reject at low
turnouts, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority-carries as below.

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;{against&space;\over&space;\sqrt{electorate}}&space;<&space;{approve&space;\over&space;\sqrt{turnout}})

##### Simple-Majority

Majority-carries, a simple comparison of votes; if there are more aye votes than nay, then the
proposal is carried, no matter how much stake votes on the proposal.

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;{approve}&space;>&space;{against})

_To know more about where these above formulas come from, please read the
[democracy pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/democracy/src/vote_threshold.rs)_.

Example:

Assume we only have {{ polkadot: 1_500 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 1_50 :kusama }} tokens in total and
that this is a public proposal.

- John:  {{ polkadot: 500 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 50 KSM :kusama }}
- Peter: {{ polkadot: 100 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 10 KSM :kusama }}
- Lilly: {{ polkadot: 150 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 15 KSM :kusama }}
- JJ:    {{ polkadot: 150 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 15 KSM :kusama }}
- Ken:   {{ polkadot: 600 DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 60 KSM :kusama }}


John: Votes `Yes` for a 4 week lock period  => 
{{ polkadot: 500 x 1 = 500 Votes :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 50 x 1 = 50 Votes :kusama }}

Peter: Votes `Yes` for a 4 week lock period => 
{{ polkadot: 100 x 1 = 100 Votes :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 10 x 1 = 10 Votes :kusama }}

JJ: Votes `No` for a 16 week lock period => 
{{ polkadot: 150 x 3 = 450 Votes :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 150 x 3 = 450 Votes :kusama }}

- approve = {{ polkadot: 600 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 60 :kusama }}
- against = {{ polkadot: 450 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 45 :kusama }}
- turnout = {{ polkadot: 750 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 75 :kusama }}
- electorate = {{ polkadot: 1500 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 150 :kusama }} 

![\Large \frac{450}{\sqrt{750}}&space;<&space;\frac{600}{\sqrt{1500}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;\frac{450}{\sqrt{750}}&space;<&space;\frac{600}{\sqrt{1500}})

![\Large {16.432}&space;<&space;{15.492}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;{16.432}&space;<&space;{15.492})

Since the above example is a public referendum, `Super-Majority Approve` would be used to calculate
the result. `Super-Majority Approve` requires more `aye` votes to pass the referendum when turnout
is low, therefore, based on the above result, the referendum will be rejected. In addition, only the
winning voter's tokens are locked. If the voters on the losing side of the referendum believe that
the outcome will have negative effects, their tokens are transferrable so they will not be locked
into the decision. Moreover, winning proposals are autonomously enacted only after some enactment
period.

#### Voluntary Locking

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} utilizes an idea called `Voluntary Locking` 
that allows token holders to increase their voting power by declaring how long they are willing to lock up 
their tokens, hence, the number of votes for each token holder will be calculated by the following formula:

```
votes = tokens * conviction_multiplier
```

The conviction multiplier increases the vote multiplier by one every time the number of lock periods
double.

| Lock Periods | Vote Multiplier |
| :----------: | :-------------: |
|      0       |       0.1       |
|      1       |        1        |
|      2       |        2        |
|      4       |        3        |
|      8       |        4        |
|      16      |        5        |
|      32      |        6        |

The maximum number of "doublings" of the lock period is set to 6 (and thus 32 lock periods in
total), and one lock period equals {{ polkadot: 28 days :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 8 days :kusama }}. 
Only doublings are allowed; you cannot lock for, say, 24 periods and increase your conviction 
by 5.5, for instance.

While a token is locked, you can still use it for voting and staking; you are only prohibited from
transferring these tokens to another account.

Votes are still "counted" at the same time (at the end of the voting period), no matter for how long
the tokens are locked.

#### Adaptive Quorum Biasing

{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} introduces a concept, 
"Adaptive Quorum Biasing", which functions as a lever that the council can use to alter the effective 
super-majority required to make it easier or more difficult for a proposal to pass in the case that there 
is no clear majority of voting power backing it or against it.

![](../assets/governance/adaptive-quorum-biasing.png)

Let's use the above image as an example.

If a publicly submitted referendum only has a 25% turnout, the tally of "aye" votes has to reach 66%
for it to pass since we applied `Positive Turnout Bias`.

In contrast, when it has a 75% turnout, the tally of "aye" votes has to reach 54%, which means that
the super-majority required decreases as the turnout increases.

When the council proposes a new proposal through unanimous consent, the referendum would be put to a
vote using "Negative Turnout Bias". In this case, it is easier to pass this proposal with low
turnout and requires a super-majority to reject. As more token holders participate in voting, the
bias approaches a plain majority carries.

Referring to the above image, when a referendum only has 25% turnout, the tally of "aye" votes has
to reach 34% for it to pass.

In short, when the turnout rate is low, a super-majority is required to reject the proposal, which
means a lower threshold of "aye" votes have to be reached, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it
becomes a simple majority.

All three tallying mechanisms - majority carries, super-majority approve, and super-majority
against - equate to a simple majority-carries system at 100% turnout.

## Council

To represent passive stakeholders, {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} 
introduces the idea of a "council". The council is an on-chain entity comprising several actors, each 
represented as an on-chain account. On {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}, 
the council currently consists of {{ polkadot: 13 members :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 19 members :kusama }}.

Along with [controlling the treasury](learn-treasury.md), the council is called upon primarily for
three tasks of governance: proposing sensible referenda, cancelling uncontroversially dangerous or
malicious referenda, and electing the technical committee.

For a referendum to be proposed by the council, a strict majority of members must be in favor, with
no member exercising a veto. Vetoes may be exercised only once by a member for any single proposal;
if, after a cool-down period, the proposal is resubmitted, they may not veto it a second time.

Council motions which pass with a 3/5 (60%) super-majority - but without reaching unanimous
support - will move to a public referendum under a neutral, majority-carries voting scheme. In the
case that all members of the council vote in favor of a motion, the vote is considered unanimous and
becomes a referendum with negative adaptive quorum biasing.

### Canceling

A proposal can be canceled if the [technical committee](#technical-committee) unanimously agrees to
do so, or if Root origin (e.g. sudo) triggers this functionality. A canceled proposal's deposit is
burned.

Additionally, a two-thirds majority of the council can cancel a referendum. This may function as a
last-resort if there is an issue found late in a referendum's proposal such as a bug in the code of
the runtime that the proposal would institute.

If the cancellation is controversial enough that the council cannot get a two-thirds majority, then
it will be left to the stakeholders *en masse* to determine the fate of the proposal.

### Blacklisting

A proposal can be blacklisted by Root origin (e.g. sudo). A blacklisted proposal and its related
referendum (if any) is immediately [canceled](#canceling). Additionally, a blacklisted proposal's
hash cannot re-appear in the proposal queue. Blacklisting is useful when removing erroneous
proposals that could be submitted with the same hash, i.e.
[proposal #2](https://polkascan.io/polkadot/democracy/proposal/2) in which the submitter used plain
text to make a suggestion.

Upon seeing their proposal removed, a submitter who is not properly introduced to the democracy
system of {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} might be tempted to re-submit 
the same proposal. That said, this is far from a fool-proof method of preventing invalid proposals from 
being submitted - a single changed character in a proposal's text will also change the hash of the proposal, 
rendering the per-hash blacklist invalid.

### How to be a council member?

![](../assets/governance/approval-vote.png)

All stakeholders are free to signal their approval of any of the registered candidates.

Council elections are handled by the same [Phragmén election](learn-phragmen.md) process that
selects validators from the available pool based on nominations. However, token holders' votes for
councillors are isolated from any of the nominations they may have on validators. Council terms last
for one {{ kusama: day :kusama }}{{ polkadot: week :polkadot }}.

At the end of each term, [Phragmén election algorithm](learn-phragmen.md) runs and the result will
choose the new councillors based on the vote configurations of all voters. The election also chooses
a set number of runners up which is currently ({{ kusama: 12 :kusama }}{{ polkadot: 20 :polkadot }} 
that will remain in the queue with their votes intact.

As opposed to a "first-past-the-post" electoral system, where voters can only vote for a single
candidate from a list, a Phragmén election is a more expressive way to include each voters' views.
Token holders can treat it as a way to support as many candidates as they want. The election
algorithm will find a fair subset of the candidates that most closely matches the expressed
indications of the electorate as a whole.

Let's take a look at the example below.

|      Round 1      |     |                |     |     |     |
| :---------------: | :-: | :------------: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Token Holders** |     | **Candidates** |     |     |     |
|                   |  A  |       B        |  C  |  D  |  E  |
|       Peter       |  X  |                |  X  |  X  |  X  |
|       Alice       |     |       X        |     |     |     |
|        Bob        |     |                |  X  |  X  |  X  |
|      Kelvin       |  X  |                |  X  |     |     |
|     **Total**     |  2  |       1        |  3  |  2  |  2  |

The above example shows that candidate C wins the election in round 1, while candidates A, B, D & E
keep remaining on the candidates' list for the next round.

|      Round 2      |     |                |     |     |
| :---------------: | :-: | :------------: | :-: | :-: |
| **Token Holders** |     | **Candidates** |     |     |
|                   |  A  |       B        |  D  |  E  |
|       Peter       |  X  |       X        |     |     |
|       Alice       |  X  |       X        |     |     |
|        Bob        |  X  |       X        |  X  |  X  |
|      Kelvin       |  X  |       X        |     |     |
|     **Total**     |  4  |       4        |  1  |  1  |

For the top-N (say 4 in this example) runners-up, they can remain and their votes persist until the
next election. After round 2, even though candidates A & B get the same number of votes in this
round, candidate A gets elected because after adding the older unused approvals, it is higher than
B.

### Prime Members

The council, being an instantiation of
[Substrate's Collective pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/collective),
implements what's called a *prime member* whose vote acts as the default for other members that fail
to vote before the timeout.

The prime member is chosen based on a [Borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count).

The purpose of having a prime member of the council is to ensure a quorum, even when several members
abstain from a vote. Council members might be tempted to vote a "soft rejection" or a "soft
approval" by not voting and letting the others vote. With the existence of a prime member, it forces
councillors to be explicit in their votes or have their vote counted for whatever is voted on by the
prime.

## Technical Committee

The Technical Committee was introduced in the
[Kusama rollout and governance post](https://polkadot.network/kusama-rollout-and-governance/) as one
of the three chambers of Kusama governance (along with the Council and the Referendum chamber). The
Technical Committee is composed of the teams that have successfully implemented or specified either
a {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} runtime or Polkadot Host. Teams are 
added or removed from the Technical Committee via a simple majority vote of the [Council](#council).

The Technical Committee can, along with the Council, produce emergency referenda, which are
fast-tracked for voting and implementation. These are used for emergency bug fixes or rapid
implementation of new but battle-tested features into the runtime.

Fast-tracked referenda are the only type of referenda that can be active alongside another active
referendum. Thus, with fast-tracked referenda it is possible to have two active referendums at the
same time. Voting on one does not prevent a user from voting on the other.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I appeal to the council to enact a change on my behalf?

In some circumstances, you may want to appeal to the on-chain council to enact a change on your
behalf. One example of this circumstance is the case of lost or locked funds when the funds were
lost due to a human interface error (such as inputting an address for another network). Another
example is if you participated in the 2017 Polkadot ICO with a multi-sig address which now does not
let you sign a message easily. When these circumstances can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to
be an error, the council *may* consider a governance motion to correct it.

The first step to appeal to the council is to get in contact with the councillors. There is no
singular place where you are guaranteed to grab every councillor's ear with your message. However,
there are a handful of good places to start where you can get the attention of some of them. The
{{ polkadot: [Polkadot Direction][] :polkadot }}{{ kusama: [Kusama Direction][] :kusama }} matrix 
room is one such place. After creating an account and joining this room, you can post a 
well-thought-through message here that lays down your case and provides justification for why you think 
the council should consider enacting a change to the protocol on your behalf.

At some point you will likely need a place for a longer-form discussion. For this, making a post on
[Polkassembly][] is the recommended place to do so. When you write a post on Polkassembly make sure
you present all the evidence for your circumstances and state clearly what kind of change you would
suggest to the councillors to enact. 

> Remember, the councillors do not need to make the change, it is your responsibility to make a 
> strong case for why the change should be made.
