Both Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks achieve finality through GRANDPA consensus, which
enables trustless bridging of both the networks through their respective Bridge Hubs. Polkadot
Bridge Hub runs a [light client of Kusama network](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/545)
and Kusama Bridge Hub runs a
[light client of Polkadot network](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/354), which were both
enabled through their respective OpenGov referenda.
