The Polkadot network has a phased roll-out plan, with important milestones toward decentralization
marking each phase. Keep up-to-date with the Polkadot's phased roll-out plan at by viewing the

**Current Phase: Post-launch Upgrades**

!!!info "Claims"

## The PoA Launch

The Genesis block of the Polkadot network was launched on May 26, 2020, as a Proof of Authority
(PoA) network. Governance was restricted to the single Sudo (super-user) key, which was held by Web3
Foundation to issue the commands and upgrades necessary to complete the launch process. During this
time, validators started joining the network and signaling their intention to participate in
consensus.

## Nominated Proof of Stake

Once Web3 Foundation was confident in the stability of the network and there was a sufficient number
of validator intentions, Web3 Foundation used [Sudo](https://youtu.be/InekMjJpVdo) &mdash; a
superuser account with access to governance functions &mdash; to initiate the first validator
election. Following this election, the network transitioned from PoA into its second phase,
[Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)](../learn-staking.md), on June 18, 2020.

## Governance

After the chain had been running well with the validator set, the Sudo key issued a runtime upgrade
that enabled the suite of governance modules in Polkadot; namely, the modules to enable a
[Council](learn-governance.md#council), a
[Technical Committee](learn-governance.md#technical-committee), and
[public referenda](learn-governance.md#public-referenda).

## Removal of Sudo

The Sudo module was removed by a runtime upgrade on July 20, 2020, transitioning the
[governance](learn-governance.md) of the chain into the hands of the token (DOT) holders.

From this point, the network has been entirely in the hands of the token holders and is no longer
under control of any centralized authority.

## Balance Transfers

To enable balance transfers, the community made a public proposal for a runtime upgrade that lifted
the restriction on balance transfers. Transfer functionality was subsequently enabled on Polkadot at
block number 1_205_128 on August 18, 2020, at 16:39 UTC.

## Core Functionality

After five years of research and development and a multi-stage launch that began in May 2020,
Polkadot launch was completed on December 18, 2021, with all auction-winning parachains producing
blocks on the network.
