# Weight and fees

The resources available to a blockchain are limited, so it's important to manage how operations
on-chain use them. Not managing how resources are used can open an attack vector, known as DoS
(Denial of Service), where an attacker floods the chain with operations in order to get it to stop
producing blocks. In order to manage how resources are used and to protect against DoS attacks, XCM
uses a concept of _weight_. This concept, which has the purpose of quantifying usage of blockchain
resources, comes from the [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/) world.

Weight is two-dimensional, it tracks both time (execution time) and space (state accesses). Weight
determines how much fees need to be paid in order to perform some operation. The logic for turning
it into fees is configurable.

Some systems have the concept of _gas metering_, which is calculated during execution and only
measures execution time. Weight, however, is static, defined beforehand, which makes XCM execution
lighter by not including gas metering.

The principle behind weight payment is to pay for what you use, so the two stages of XCM where fees
are paid are _sending_ the message and actually _executing_ it. The fees for sending are paid on the
local system, usually by the origin of the message, because we are using the message delivery
mechanism maintained by the origin. Similarly, the execution fees are paid on the destination
system, via the `BuyExecution` instruction. In other words, XCMs are paid for via their own
instructions. We'll talk more about `BuyExecution` in the
[fee handling chapter](../journey/fees/index.html).

XCM is agnostic, which means it doesn't assume fees need to be paid. It's entirely possible to not
pay for the effects of an XCM on the destination system. Even in systems where fees have to be paid,
special cases of free execution can be made. There are security measures systems can put in place
(see [barrier](../executor_config/index.html#barrier)) to not execute XCMs that do not pay for their
fees.

## Executor config

The executor has a `Weigher` [configuration item](../executor_config/index.html#weigher) that
specifies the weight of each instruction. It weighs the whole message by adding the weight of each
instruction. A simple way of weighing instructions is to assign them a base weight value to all of
them. This works, but it is not very accurate, as different instructions use more resources when
being executed. A better approach is to benchmark each instruction to find out the actual weight
used by each.

Another configuration item, `Trader`, converts the required weight units into fees, which are
represented as `MultiAsset`s. There are two basic approaches: one is to just assign a value
(measured in assets) to each unit of weight; the other is to reuse some existing transaction payment
method for XCM weight. Custom configurations allow for things like NFT coupons that give you a
certain amount of weight for executing the XCM.

Naturally, this configuration items allow for any approach you can think of for weighing messages
and charging execution fees.

## XCM pallet

FRAME pallets, like the XCM pallet, specify weights for each extrinsic they expose. That means that
when interacting with pallets that deal with XCM, there will be an additional fee at the beginning
for calling the extrinsic locally.
