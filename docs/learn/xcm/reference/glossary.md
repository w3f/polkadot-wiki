# Glossary

## XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging)

A messaging format meant to communicate intentions between consensus systems. XCM could also refer
to a single message.

## Instructions

XCMs are composed of a sequence of instructions. Each instruction aims to convey a particular
intention. There are instructions for transferring and locking assets, handling fees, calling
arbitrary blobs, and more.

## Consensus system

A system that can reach any kind of consensus. For example, relay chains, parachains, smart
contracts.

## MultiLocation

A way of addressing consensus systems. These could be relative or absolute.

## Junction

The different ways of descending down a `MultiLocation` hierarchy. A junction can be a Parachain, an
Account, or more.

## MultiAsset

A way of identifying assets in the same or another consensus system, by using a `MultiLocation`.

## Sovereign account

An account on a consensus system that is controlled by an account in another consensus system.

## Teleport

A way of transferring assets between two consensus systems without the need of a third party. It
consists of the sender system burning the asset that wants to be sent over and the recipient minting
an equivalent amount of that asset. It requires a lot of trust between the two systems, since
failure to mint or burn will reduce the total issuance of the token.

## Reserve asset transfer

A way of transferring assets between two consensus systems that don't trust each other, by using a
third system they both trust, called the reserve. The real asset only exists on the reserve, both
sender and recipient only deal with derivatives. It consists of the sender burning a certain amount
of derivatives, telling the reserve to move real assets from its sovereign account to the
destination's sovereign account, and then telling the recipient to mint the right amount of
derivatives.

## XCVM

The virtual machine behind XCM. Every XCM is an XCVM programme. Holds state in registers.

## Holding register

An XCVM register used to hold arbitrary `Asset`s during the execution of an XCVM programme.

## Barrier

An XCM executor configuration item that works as a firewall for incoming XCMs. All XCMs have to pass
the barrier to be executed, else they are dropped. It can be used for whitelisting only certain
types or messages or messages from certain senders.

## UMP (Upward Message Passing)

Transport-layer protocol that allows parachains to send messages upwards to their relay chain.

## DMP (Downward Message Passing)

Transport-layer protocol that allows the relay chain to send messages downwards to one of their
parachains.

## XCMP (Cross-Consensus Message Passing)

Transport-layer protocol that allows parachains to send messages between themselves, without going
through the relay chain.

## HRMP (Horizontal Message Passing)

Transport-layer protocol that allows a parachain to send messages to a sibling parachain going
through the relay chain. It's a precursor to XCMP, also known as XCMP-lite. It uses a mixture of UMP
and VMP.
