Validators secure the [Relay Chain](learn-architecture.md#relay-chain) by staking DOT, validating
proofs from collators and participating in consensus with other validators.

These participants play a crucial role in adding new blocks to the Relay Chain and, by extension, to
all parachains. This allows parties to complete cross-chain transactions via the Relay Chain.
Parachain validators participate in some form of off-chain consensus, and submit candidate receipts
to the tx pool for a block producer to include on-chain. The Relay Chain validators guarantee that
each parachain follows its unique rules and can pass messages between shards in a trust-free
environment.

With parachains now on the network, para-validators are selected every epoch to validate parachain
blocks for all parachains connected to the Relay Chain. Para-validators work in groups to validate
parachain blocks.

The selected para-validators are one of
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="query.staking.validatorCount" defaultValue={297}/> :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="query.staking.validatorCount" defaultValue={1000}/> :kusama }}
validators randomly selected (per epoch) to participate in the validation, creating a validator pool
of 200 para-validators.

Validators perform two functions:

1. **Verifying** that the information contained in an assigned set of parachain blocks is valid
   (such as the identities of the transacting parties and the subject matter of the contract).
2. **Participating** in the consensus mechanism to produce the Relay Chain blocks based on validity
   statements from other validators. Any instances of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms
   result in punishment by removal of some or all of the validatorâ€™s staked DOT, thereby
   discouraging bad actors. Good performance, however, will be rewarded, with validators receiving
   block rewards (including transaction fees) in the form of DOT in exchange for their activities.
