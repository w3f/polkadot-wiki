Collators maintain parachains by collecting parachain transactions from users and producing state
transition proofs for Relay Chain validators. In other words, collators maintain parachains by
aggregating parachain transactions into parachain block candidates and producing state transition
proofs for validators based on those blocks.

Collators maintain a full node for the Relay Chain and a full node for their particular parachain;
meaning they retain all necessary information to be able to author new blocks and execute
transactions in much the same way as miners do on current PoW blockchains. Under normal
circumstances, they will collate and execute transactions to create an unsealed block and provide
it, together with a proof of state transition, to one or more validators responsible for proposing a
parachain block.

Unlike validators, collator nodes do not secure the network. If a parachain block is invalid, it
will get rejected by validators. Therefore the assumption that having more collators is better or
more secure is not correct. On the contrary, too many collators may slow down the network. The only
nefarious power collators have is transaction censorship. To prevent censorship, a parachain only
needs to ensure that there exist some neutral collators - but not necessarily a majority.
Theoretically, the censorship problem is solved with having just one honest collator.

## XCM

Collators are a key element of the [XCM (Cross-Consensus Message Passing Format)](learn-xcm.md). By
being full nodes of the Relay Chain, they are all aware of each other as peers. This makes it
possible for them to send messages from parachain A to parachain B.

## Taking the Case for One Parachain

A start of a new block candidate is initiated with a block creation time. The collator aggregates
all new transactions at the end of the process. When doing so, the collator signs the _parachain
block candidate_ and produces state transition proofs, which are a summary of the final account
balances caused by the transactions in the candidate block. The collator relays the candidate block
and state transition proofs to the validators on-chain. The validators verify the transactions
within the parachain block candidate. Upon verification, and if all is well, the validator shares
the candidate block with the Relay Chain.

Parachain block candidates are collected together and a _Relay Chain block candidate_ is produced.

The validators on the network will try to reach a consensus on the Relay Chain block candidate. Upon
reaching consensus, the now validated Relay Chain block candidate is shared with the validators and
collators, and the process repeats for new transactions. A collator cannot continue building blocks
on a parachain until the block candidate they proposed to the Relay Chain validators have been
validated.

A block is produced every 6 seconds.

## Collators in the Wild

Blockchains that are built using Substrate are unable to hook onto the Relay Chain on their own. The
Parity team built the [Cumulus library](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/) to address this.
Collators are being used on the
[Rococo](../build/build-parachains.md##testing-a-parachains:-rococo-testnet) testnet, and you can
learn more about how they are used with Cumulus via the
[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/) repository. More information can be found under
the [Cumulus section](../build/build-parachains.md###cumulus) on the build parachain page.

- [Tutorial covering Cumulus and Collators](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/connect-other-chains/)
- [Rococo testnet guide](../build/build-parachains.md##testing-a-parachains:-rococo-testnet)
- [polkadot-launch](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/polkadot-launch) - a tool to quickly spin up a
  local Polkadot testnet based on some parameters like number of parachains, collator setup, etc.
