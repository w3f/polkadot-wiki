In the Polkadot ecosystem, accounts are generated and managed through wallets. There is no central "sign up" page—instead, you choose a wallet that suits your needs, and use it to generate your cryptographic keys (your account).

Below are the recommended wallets you can use to create your first account, ranging from user-friendly mobile apps to secure hardware devices.

## Create with a Browser Extension or Mobile App

These wallets are the easiest way to get started. They are perfect for everyday use, connecting to dApps, and managing your portfolio.
