Security is your responsibility in the world of Web3. Since there is no bank or central authority to reverse transactions, you must take steps to protect your account.

## Top Security Tips

### 1. Protect Your Seed Phrase
*   **Write it down on paper.** Do not store it digitally (no screenshots, no text files, no emails).
*   **Store it safely.** Use a fireproof safe or a secure location only you know.
*   **Never share it.** No official support agent or admin will ever ask for your seed phrase.

### 2. Use a Cold Wallet for Large Amounts
*   If you hold significant value, use a **Hardware Wallet** (like Ledger) or **Polkadot Vault**.
*   Keep only small amounts for daily use in "hot wallets" (browser extensions/mobile apps).

### 3. Verify Before You Sign
*   **Check the URL.** Ensure you are on the correct website before connecting your wallet. Phishing sites often look identical to real ones.
*   **Read the transaction.** Don't just click "Sign". Verify the destination address and the operation you are approving.

### 4. Beware of Scams
*   **Fake Airdrops:** Be skeptical of free tokens.
*   **Impersonators:** Scammers often pretend to be support staff on Discord, Telegram, or Twitter.
*   **Malicious Links:** Do not click suspicious links sent via DM.
