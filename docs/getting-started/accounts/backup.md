Backing up your account is the single most important step after creating it. Without a backup, device failure or accidental deletion means total loss of funds.

## Types of Backups

### 1. Mnemonic Seed Phrase (Primary Backup)
This is the 12-24 word phrase you received when creating the account.
*   **Pros:** Universally compatible. Can recover your account in almost any wallet.
*   **Cons:** Must be typed precisely. Susceptible to physical theft if not hidden.

### 2. JSON Backup File (secondary)
Some wallets (like Polkadot.js extension) allow you to export a generic encrypted `.json` file.
*   **Pros:** Encrypted with a password. Easy to import.
*   **Cons:** Requires the password to decrypt. Not supported by all wallets.

## How to Backup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exact steps depend on the wallet you are using.

For detailed instructions on exporting your backup from specific wallets, please refer to the wallet's official documentation or Polkadot Support:

## Storing Your Backup

*   **Offline is best:** Paper or metal plate backups are immune to hackers.
*   **Multiple locations:** Consider keeping a copy in two different secure locations (e.g., your home safe and a bank safety deposit box) to protect against fire or flood.
