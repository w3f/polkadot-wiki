## Polkadot Staking Dashboards

For the best staking experience, it is recommended to use a dedicated staking dashboard. These platforms provide a user-friendly interface to manage your stake, view rewards, and select validators.

- **[Polkadot Staking Dashboard](../../build/solutions/staking-dashboard.md)**: The official, comprehensive dashboard for staking on Polkadot. It supports various wallets and provides in-depth analytics.
- **[Polkadot Staking Apps](../../build/solutions/staking-apps.md)**: A collection of community-built apps and tools that offer alternative interfaces and features for staking.

## Stake DOT Using Talisman

Talisman is a user-friendly wallet that integrates seamlessly with the Polkadot ecosystem. You can stake your DOT using Talisman by connecting it to the Polkadot Staking Dashboard.

## Stake DOT Using Polkadot.js

!!!warning "Advanced Users Only"
    Polkadot.js is a powerful, developer-oriented interface that provides full control over your staking operations. It is **recommended for advanced users only** who need granular control over their accounts and validator selection. For most users, likely one of the dashboards or wallets above is a better choice.

For detailed instructions on how to stake using Polkadot.js, please refer to the official support guides:

## Common Mistakes & FAQ

Staking on Polkadot can be rewarding, but it's important to avoid common pitfalls. Here are some frequently asked questions and mistakes to watch out for:

### Why am I not getting staking rewards?

There are several reasons you might not be receiving rewards:

- **Minimum Active Bond Not Met**: The minimum amount of DOT required to earn rewards is dynamic and changes based on network conditions. Even if you bond more than the minimum intention threshold, you may not be in the top nominators if your stake is below the current minimum active bond. Check the current minimum on the Staking Dashboard's "Nominate" page.
- **Not Enough Validators Nominated**: You should nominate up to 16 validators to maximize your chances of having at least one active validator each era. Nominating only one or two validators significantly reduces your earning potential.
- **100% Commission Validators**: If you nominate a validator with 100% commission, you will receive no rewards when your stake is assigned to that validator.
- **Inactive or Waiting Validators**: Your stake must back an active validator to earn rewards. If all your nominated validators are "waiting" or "inactive," you won't earn rewards.
- **Unclaimed Rewards**: Staking rewards are not automatic. While validators typically claim rewards, you should monitor and manually claim if needed. Rewards expire after 84 eras (approximately 84 days) on Polkadot.

### Other Common Mistakes

- **Not Monitoring Your Nominations**: Staking is not "set-and-forget." Regularly review your nominated validators' performance and make adjustments as needed.
- **Ignoring Validator Research**: Choose validators based on performance, reputation, commission rates, and slashing history. Don't just pick validators at random.
- **Withdrawing Too Early**: Be patient with staking rewards. Avoid the temptation to constantly switch validators or withdraw prematurely due to short-term fluctuations.
