## Stake DOT Using Polkadot.js

!!!warning "Advanced Users Only"
    Polkadot.js is a powerful, developer-oriented interface that provides full control over your staking operations. It is **recommended for advanced users only** who need granular control over their accounts and validator selection. For most users, likely one of the dashboards or wallets above is a better choice.
