# Voting on Referenda

Voting is the primary way to participate in Polkadot governance. You can vote on any active referendum using your DOT tokens.

## Voting Options

When you vote, you have four options:

-   **Aye**: You support the proposal.
-   **Nay**: You oppose the proposal.
-   **Split**: You can split your vote, casting some DOT as Aye and some as Nay.
-   **Abstain**: You want to participate in the turnout (Support) without taking a side (Approval).

## Conviction Voting

Polkadot uses a mechanism called **Conviction Voting**. This allows you to increase the weight of your vote by agreeing to lock your tokens for a longer period.

-   **0.1x**: No lock required (votes count for 10% of your balance).
-   **1x**: Locked for 1x the enactment period (votes count for 100% of your balance).
-   **2x**: Locked for 2x the enactment period (votes count for 200% of your balance).
-   ...up to **6x**.

!!!note "Locks do not prevent staking"
    Tokens locked for governance can still be used for staking! You do not need to choose between voting and earning staking rewards.

## How to Vote

### Voting Interfaces
You can vote using several different community tools:
-   **[Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/)** & **[Subsquare](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/)**: Web-based governance platforms.
-   **[Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/)**: Mobile wallet with built-in governance.
-   **[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)**: Advanced developer interface.
