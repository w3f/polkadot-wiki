# Tracking Governance Activity

With so many proposals happening simultaneously in OpenGov, it is important to have tools that help you filter the noise and focus on what matters to you.

## Monitoring Tools

### Subsquare & Polkassembly
[Subsquare](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/) and [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/) are excellent for tracking specific referenda or general activity.
-   **Discussion Feeds**: See the latest comments and debates.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauge how the community is feeling about a proposal.
-   **User Profiles**: Track the voting history of specific accounts.

### Nova Wallet (Mobile)
[Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/) provides push notifications for governance events, making it easy to stay updated on the go.
-   **Alerts**: Get notified when a referendum you voted on is passing or failing.
-   **Track Filtering**: Only see proposals from the tracks you care about (e.g., "staking admin" vs. "treasurer").

### Block Explorers
[Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/referenda) and [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) are block explorers that provide raw data verification and chain state inspection.

-   **[Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/referenda)**: Detailed analytics and visualization of voting data.
-   **[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)**: Direct chain state inspection.

## Key Metrics to Watch

The following are some of the key metrics to watch for a referendum:

-   **Turnout**: How many tokens are participating?
-   **Approval**: Is the proposal passing the approval threshold?
-   **Support**: Is there enough turnout to meet the support threshold?
-   **Decision Period**: How much time is left before the vote closes?
