# Introduction to Polkadot Governance

Polkadot's governance system is unique because it is entirely on-chain. Holders of the DOT token can propose changes to the network and vote on them directly. This allows the network to evolve and upgrade itself without hard forks.

The current version of Polkadot's governance is called **OpenGov**. It is designed to be decentralized, transparent, and efficient.

    For a deep dive into the concepts and history of Polkadot governance, see the [OpenGov Knowledge Base article](../../knowledge-base/opengov.md).

## Why Participate?

Governance is the mechanism by which the Polkadot network makes decisions. By participating, you can help shape the future of the network. Decisions made through governance include:

- **Treasury Spending**: Funding for development, marketing, and community events.
- **Network Upgrades**: Fixing bugs and adding new features.
- **Parameter Changes**: Adjusting fees, staking rewards, and other network parameters.

## Governance Tools

There is no single "official" website for Polkadot governance. Instead, there is an ecosystem of tools that interact with the on-chain system. You can choose the tool that best fits your needs:

| Tool | Best For | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| **[Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/)** | Discussion, Voting, Proposing | Web |
| **[Subsquare](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/)** | Discussion, Voting, Tracking | Web |
| **[Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/)** | Mobile Voting & Delegation | Mobile App |
| **[Polkassembly Delegation](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/delegation)** | Finding Delegates | Web |
| **[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)** | Power Users, Advanced Operations | Web |

## Getting Started

To participate in governance, you need to have DOT tokens. You can then:

1.  **Vote**: Use your DOT to vote on active referenda.
2.  **Delegate**: Entrust your voting power to a delegate who aligns with your views.
3.  **Propose**: Submit your own proposals for the network to consider.

The following guides will walk you through the practical steps of participating in Polkadot governance.
