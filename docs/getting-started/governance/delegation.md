# Delegating Your Vote

You don't have to vote on every single referenda yourself. Polkadot governance allows you to delegate your voting power to others you trust.

## Why Delegate?

-   **Save Time**: Following every proposal can be a full-time job.
-   **Expertise**: Delegate to experts in specific fields (e.g., technical upgrades vs. treasury spending).
-   **Passive participation**: Ensure your DOT is still "active" in governance even if you are offline.

## How Delegation Works

-   **You keep your DOT**: Delegation does *not* transfer your tokens. You still hold them in your wallet.
-   **Revocable**: You can undelegate or change your delegate at any time.
-   **Granular**: You can delegate different "Tracks" to different people. For example, delegate "Treasurer" tracks to a financial expert and "Root" tracks to a technical expert.
-   **Override**: If you disagree with your delegate on a specific vote, you can vote yourself, and your vote will override theirs.
