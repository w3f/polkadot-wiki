The Web3 Foundation offers two types of grants:

- The [Open Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program) is Web3 Foundation's
  standard program, which offers fast funding of up to $30k for initial grants and $100k for
  follow-up ones. Applications are tracked transparently on GitHub and disbursed in
  cryptocurrencies.
- The [General Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program) offers funding of up
  to $100k per grant and covers all other cases, including private applications and fiat payments.

More information regarding guidelines, support, and the application process for each program can be
found at the above links.

Accepted applications for both programs can be found
[here](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md).

## Alternative Funding Sources

### Polkadot Treasury

The Polkadot Treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing,
staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. Both
Polkadot and Kusama offer everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury. See:
