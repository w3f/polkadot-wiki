## What is Polkadot?

!!!info "Explore Polkadot with [user-friendly wallets](https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/wallets/)."

Polkadot is a **blockchain-based multi-core decentralized cloud computer**. Let's break it down bit by bit:

- **blockchain-based:** Polkadot at its heart has a blockchain that permanently and immutably stores sensitive information about the protocol and applications running on top of it
- **multi-core:** Like traditional computers, Polkadot has a virtual CPU with multiple virtual cores
- **decentralized cloud computer:** Instead of being run by a single entity, Polkadot is run by real computers owned by different operators (validators) scattered around the globe, part of a decentralized peer-to-peer network

**Polkadot is a Web3 service provider**: it provides secure and resilient computation and interoperability for any application connected to its network. Applications can be fully-fledged blockchains deployed as rollups on Polkadot (also known as [parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md)). Instead of bootstrapping their security, rollups can connect to Polkadot via its virtual cores by buying [coretime](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md) with DOT and tap into Polkadot's multi-billion shared security. By doing so, they inherently access Polkadot's secure interoperability and can communicate with other applications running on different cores of Polkadot's virtual CPU.

Polkadot is owned by the [DOT token](../learn/learn-DOT.md) holders who can shape its future through on-chain [governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) (also called Polkadot
OpenGov) to orchestrate decisions, including accessing funds from the
[treasury](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md). Technical changes to the protocol's code are enacted and implemented automatically. Token holders can cast [direct votes](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#voting-on-a-referendum), [delegate their voting power](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#multirole-delegation) to entities and DAOs they trust, and place deposits for their referenda or referenda proposed by others.

In addition to purchasing coretime and voting in governance, the DOT token gives you the power to participate in Polkadot [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md) and help secure the network. For node operators, DOT can also enable you to participate in programs like the [Decentralized Nodes program](https://nodes.web3.foundation/).

Polkadot's level of abstraction and generalization allows for building applications 
specific to their use cases, and for those applications to communicate securely, leveraging each
other's value proposition. The trustless cooperation between applications makes Polkadot an
ideal ecosystem to build a [web3 future](web3-and-polkadot.md).

## Learning about Polkadot and Web3

Depending on your understanding of blockchain, Web3, and Polkadot, several learning resources exist.

### Beginner Level

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxVihxZC42nF_MCN9PTvZMIifRjx9cZ2J&feature=shared): an introduction to blockchain technology to start familiarizing yourself with concepts such as cryptography and peer-to-peer networks.
- [Polkadot's light paper](https://polkadot.com/papers/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf): a visual, easy to
  read, and less technical introduction into Polkadot's technology. This paper dives into the
  components of Polkadot and is tailored for both a non-technical and technical reader.
- [Polkadot for Beginners: A non-technical guide to decentralization, blockchains & Polkadot](https://linktr.ee/polkadotbook): a book funded by the Polkadot Treasury about Blockchain technology with a dive into the Polkadot protocol, its participants and components.

### Intermediate Level

- [Polkadot's original white paper](https://polkadot.com/papers/Polkadot-whitepaper.pdf): the original Polkadot white
  paper that describes [Polkadot 1.0](./polkadot-v1.md) and how Polkadot's core components work together.
- [Polkadot's overview paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13456): an updated version of the white
  paper that describes the protocol in more technical terms.
- [The Technical Explainer Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8):
  These introductory videos explain and demonstrate how to interact with Polkadot using the [Polkadot-JS tools](./polkadotjs.md) and more user-friendly [wallets](https://polkadot.com/get-started/wallets/).
- [Polkadot Knowledge Base](https://support.polkadot.network/) - Troubleshooting resources for
  specific errors and problems while using tools such as the [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](./dashboards/staking-dashboard.md) and [Polkadot-JS UI](./polkadotjs-ui.md).

### Advanced Level

- [The Web3 Foundation's research site](https://research.web3.foundation/): up-to-date technical research on Polkadot, including scalability, cryptographic,
  economic, and security aspects of the protocol.
- [Polkadot's specification](https://spec.polkadot.network/id-polkadot-protocol): the latest Polkadot Host protocol specification, Polkadot's specification tests of the many components of the network, and the Polkadot Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and
  explores how various processes function in the Polkadot network. The Polkadot specification takes
  Polkadot's ideas and concepts from the light and the white paper, but focuses on the technical
  specs of the technology.
- [ELVES protocol paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/961.pdf): a technical scientific paper of Polkadot's shared security model.
- [The Polkadot Parachain Host Implementer's Guide](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/book/index.html): an extensive description of Polkadot's shared security model.
