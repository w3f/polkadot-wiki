:::info Welcome to the Polkadot Wiki

The Polkadot Wiki serves as the central source of truth for Polkadot. It is a community-focused
initiative led by Web3 Foundation to keep an up-to-date resource on the best information for
learning, building, and maintaining on Polkadot.

The Wiki has three main sections: Learn (for learners), Build (for people that want to build on
Polkadot), and Maintain (for people that want to maintain the network).

:::

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is the first fully-sharded blockchain.

Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a
secure, trust-free environment.

Polkadot is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless
networks, private consortium chains, or other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where
independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

Polkadot is a living network with the core pillars of governance and upgradability. The network has
an advanced suite of governance tools and, using the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
standard as a "meta-protocol", can autonomously deploy network upgrades. Polkadot adapts to your
growing needs without the risks of network forks.

:::note Learn more about Governance

If you haven't heard of Governance before, a great place to start is the
[Governance page](../learn/learn-governance.md)

::: By connecting these dots, Polkadot serves as a foundational layer of a decentralized web, where
users control their data and are not limited by trust bounds within the network.

### What can I do with my DOT?

[DOT](../learn/learn-DOT.md) is the native token of the Polkadot Network. DOT can be used for
transaction fees, staking, governance, acquisition of a parachain slot and for enabling several key
functionalities on Polkadot.

- **1 DOT**: the minimum balance required to have an active account on Polkadot Network. If your
  account balance drops below 1 DOT, your account will be reaped. Learn more about
  [Accounts](../learn/learn-accounts.md) and the
  [Existential Deposit](../build/build-protocol-info.md#existential-deposit) requirement. With 1 DOT
  you can also join a [nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md) and contribute to
  network security and for doing than you will get staking rewards.
- **5 DOT**: the minimum contribution required to participate in
  [crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md) for
  [parachain slot auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md).

- **10 DOT**: the minimum stake required to submit your intent to nominate validators. But, to
  increase the chance of earning staking rewards, your stake should not be less than the minimum
  stake among the active nominators which is a dynamic threshold. Learn more about
  [becoming a nominator](../learn/learn-nominator.md).

- **20 DOT**: you can register an [on-chain identity](../learn/learn-identity.md), vote for
  [council](../maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-vote-councillor.md), or create a
  [proxy account](../learn/learn-proxies.md).

- **200 DOT**: you can create your own [nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md).

DOT has utility in [Polkadot's democracy](../maintain/maintain-guides-democracy.md). Bonding DOT is
a requirement to create proposals, to endorse them and to vote on them when they become referendums.
Bonding 100 DOT or 5% of requested funding is a requirement to make a
[treasury proposal](../learn/learn-treasury.md#creating-a-treasury-proposal). DOT can also enable
you to participate in programs like the
[Thousand Validators Program](../general/thousand-validators.md#polkadot).

## Why Polkadot?

Back in the early 2000's, when the internet was gaining popularity for the first time, the internet
featured read-only, static, basic web pages. The online connected world at the time was only the
beginning of virtual data, identities, and more. The internet during this time was also called the
Web 1.0.

As social media platforms and online businesses began to emerge, the internet transformed into the
Web 2.0. This upgraded internet, which we still use today, features dynamic, interactive web pages,
where users can read and write information plus publish their own for others to see. However, this
version of the web comes with downsides, dealing with data control, privacy issues, and the
consequences of trust. This is where the WEB3 comes into the picture.

The WEB3 is taking centralized infrastructure and applications and turning them into decentralized,
trust-free protocols. The goal is to transform the internet into a decentralized web, where users
control their own data and identity in a trust-free environment. The Web3 movement aims to remove
intermediaries and build trustless infrastructure.

## How does Polkadot Work?

The Polkadot network uses a
[sharded model](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)>) where shards - called
"[parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md)", allow transactions to be processed in parallel instead
of sequentially. Each parachain in the network has a unique state transition function (STF).
Polkadot has a Relay Chain acting as the main chain of the system. Based on Polkadot's design, as
long as a chain's logic can compile to Wasm and adheres to the Relay Chain API, then it can connect
to the Polkadot network as a parachain.

Parachains construct and propose blocks to validators on the Relay Chain, where the blocks undergo
rigorous [availability and validity](../learn/learn-availability.md) checks before being added to
the finalized chain. As the Relay Chain provides the security guarantees,
[collators](../learn/learn-collator.md) - full nodes of these parachains - don't have any security
responsibilities, and thus do not require a robust incentive system. This is how the entire network
stays up to date with the many transactions that take place.

![polkadot-relay-chain](../assets/polkadot_relay_chain.png)

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g. Bitcoin),
Polkadot has [bridge parachains](../learn/learn-bridges.md) that offer two-way compatibility,
meaning that transactions can be made between different parachains.

The [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](../learn/learn-xcm.md) allows parachains to send
messages of any type to each other. The shared security and validation logic of the Relay Chain
provide the environment for trust-free message passing that opens up true interoperability.

## Why should you use Polkadot?

Whether you're a blockchain developer or if you're interested in taking part of
[Polkadot's community](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-ambassador-program/), Polkadot offers a
platform for everyone. This wiki offers a place for builders and maintainers to utilize
[tools](../build/build-tools-index.md) and for brand-new learners to dive into educational material.

## Where to start learning?

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to start familiarizing
  yourself with blockchain concepts such as cryptography and networks, and how these play into
  things like decentralization and cryptocurrency.

This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and the course is free!

### Brand-New Polkadot learners:

- [Polkadot's original white paper][white-paper] is a technical summary around one possible
  direction of implementing the Polkadot network. This paper uses rationale and technical details to
  support why this direction is beneficial. This original white paper also explains how Polkadot's
  core components work together to build this decentralized network.
- [Polkadot's overview paper][overview-paper] is an updated version of the white paper that
  describes the protocol in more technical terms. We would recommend reading this overview paper if
  you are interested in digging more into the protocol itself.
- [Polkadot's light paper][light-paper] is a visual, easy to read, and less technical introduction
  into its blockchain technology. This paper dives into the components of Polkadot but is
  understandable for both a non-technical and technical reader.
- [Polkadot for Beginners: A non-technical guide to decentralization, blockchains &
  Polkadot][book] - a book funded by the Polkadot Treasury
- [Polkadot's specification][spec] is a GitHub repository that holds the latest Polkadot Host
  protocol specification, Polkadot's specification tests of the many components of the network, and
  the Polkadot Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and explores how various processes
  function in the Polkadot network. The Polkadot specification takes Polkadot's ideas and concepts
  from the light and the white paper but focuses on the technical specs of the technology.
- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos][teched videos]: These are great introductory videos that
  explain and demonstrate how to use Polkadot and its [User Interface][ui].
- Reading [What is Polkadot? A Brief Introduction][article] on Medium. There are also other great
  articles to read on [Polkadot's Medium][p medium] or [Web3 Foundation's Medium][w medium].

For brand-new learners of Kusama, Polkadot's canary cousin network: To learn more about how to build
and maintain on the Kusama network, please head over to our [Kusama Guide][kusama guide].
