:::info Welcome to the Polkadot Wiki

The Polkadot Wiki serves as the central source of truth for Polkadot. It is a community-focused
initiative led by Web3 Foundation to keep an up-to-date resource on the best information for
learning, building, and maintaining on Polkadot.

The Wiki has three main sections: **Learn** (for learners), **Build** (for people that want to build
on Polkadot), and **Maintain** (for people that want to maintain the network).

:::

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is the first fully-sharded blockchain, i.e. it is a multi-chain environment. Polkadot
enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure,
trust-free environment.

Polkadot is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless
networks, private consortium chains, or other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where
independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

Polkadot is a living network with the core pillars of governance and upgradability. The network has
an advanced suite of governance tools and, using the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
standard as a "meta-protocol", can autonomously deploy network upgrades. Polkadot adapts to your
growing needs without the risks of network forks.

:::note Learn more about Governance

If you haven't heard of Governance before, a great place to start is the
[Governance page](../learn/learn-governance.md)

:::

Polkadot serves as a foundational layer of a decentralized web, where users control their data and
are not limited by trust bounds within the network.

See the video below made by [DeFi Teller](https://defiteller.guru/) to know more about Polkadot.

### What can I do with my DOT?

[DOT](../learn/learn-DOT.md) is the native token of the Polkadot Network. DOT can be used for
transaction fees, staking, governance, acquisition of a parachain slot and for enabling several key
functionalities on Polkadot.

- {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={10000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
  the minimum balance required to have an active account on Polkadot Network. If your account
  balance drops below the minimum, your account will be reaped. Learn more about
  [Accounts](../learn/learn-accounts.md) and the
  [Existential Deposit](../build/build-protocol-info.md#existential-deposit) requirement.

- {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="query.nominationPools.minJoinBond" defaultValue={10000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
  the minimum contribution required to join a [nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md)
  and earn staking rewards for contributing to the security of the network. Learn more about
  [nomination pools](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md).

- {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.crowdloan.minContribution" defaultValue={50000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
  the minimum contribution required to participate in [crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md) for
  [parachain slot auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md).

- **Around 20 DOT**:

  - {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.identity.basicDeposit" defaultValue={202580000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
    register an [on-chain identity](../learn/learn-identity.md)
  - {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.phragmenElection.votingBondBase" defaultValue={200640000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
    vote for [council](../maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-vote-councillor.md)
  - {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.proxy.proxyDepositBase" defaultValue={200080000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
    create a [proxy account](../learn/learn-proxies.md).

- {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="query.staking.minNominatorBond" defaultValue={1000000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
  the minimum stake required to submit your intent to directly nominate validators.
- {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="query.staking.minimumActiveStake" defaultValue={2937000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
  the minimum amount of DOT required to become an active nominator and earn rewards, i.e. the
  minimum active bond. To increase the chance of earning staking rewards, your stake should not be
  less than the minimum stake among the active nominators, which is a dynamic threshold. If you have
  lesser DOT than the minimum active nomination, please consider contributing to
  [nomination pools](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md). Learn more about
  [becoming a nominator](../learn/learn-nominator.md).

- {{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="query.nominationPools.minCreateBond" defaultValue={2000000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>:__ :polkadot }}
  you can create your own [nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md).

DOT has utility in [Polkadot's democracy](../maintain/maintain-guides-democracy.md). Bonding DOT is
a requirement to create proposals, to endorse them and to vote on them when they become referendums.
Bonding
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.treasury.proposalBondMinimum" defaultValue={1000000000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :polkadot }}
or 5% of requested funding is a requirement to make a
[treasury proposal](../learn/learn-treasury.md#creating-a-treasury-proposal). DOT can also enable
you to participate in programs like the
[Thousand Validators Program](../general/thousand-validators.md#polkadot).

## Why Polkadot?

Back in the early 2000's, when the internet was gaining popularity for the first time, the internet
featured read-only, static, basic web pages. The online connected world at the time was only the
beginning of virtual data, identities, and more. The internet during this time was also called the
Web 1.0.

As social media platforms and online businesses began to emerge, the internet transformed into the
Web 2.0. This upgraded internet, which we still use today, features dynamic, interactive web pages,
where users can read and write information plus publish their own for others to see. However, this
version of the web comes with downsides, dealing with data control, privacy issues, and the
consequences of trust. This is where the WEB3 comes into the picture.

The Web 3.0 is taking centralized infrastructure and applications and turning them into
decentralized, trust-free protocols. The goal is to transform the internet into a decentralized web,
where users control their own data and identity in a trust-free environment. The Web3 movement aims
to remove intermediaries and build trustless infrastructure.

## How does Polkadot Work?

The Polkadot network uses a
[sharded model](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)>) where shards - called
"[parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md)", allow transactions to be processed in parallel instead
of sequentially. Each parachain in the network has a unique state transition function (STF).
Polkadot has a Relay Chain acting as the main chain of the system. Based on Polkadot's design, as
long as a chain's logic can compile to Wasm and adheres to the Relay Chain API, then it can connect
to the Polkadot network as a parachain.

Parachains construct and propose blocks to validators on the Relay Chain, where the blocks undergo
rigorous [availability and validity](../learn/learn-availability.md) checks before being added to
the finalized chain. As the Relay Chain provides the security guarantees,
[collators](../learn/learn-collator.md) - full nodes of these parachains - don't have any security
responsibilities, and thus do not require a robust incentive system. This is how the entire network
stays up to date with the many transactions that take place.

![polkadot-relay-chain](../assets/polkadot_relay_chain.png)

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g. Bitcoin),
Polkadot has [bridge parachains](../learn/learn-bridges.md) that offer two-way compatibility,
meaning that transactions can be made between different parachains.

The [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](../learn/learn-xcm.md) allows parachains to send
messages of any type to each other. The shared security and validation logic of the Relay Chain
provide the environment for trust-free message passing that opens up true interoperability.

## Why should you use Polkadot?

Whether you're a blockchain developer or if you're interested in taking part of
[Polkadot's community](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-ambassador-program/), Polkadot offers a
platform for everyone. This wiki offers a place for builders and maintainers to utilize
[tools](../build/build-tools-index.md) and for brand-new learners to dive into educational material.

## Where to start learning?

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The
  [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course](https://mooc.web3.foundation/course/blockchain-fundamentals/)
  is a great introduction to start familiarizing yourself with blockchain concepts such as
  cryptography and networks, and how these play into things like decentralization and
  cryptocurrency.

This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and the course is free!

### Brand-New Polkadot learners

- [Polkadot's original white paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf) is a technical
  summary around one possible direction of implementing the Polkadot network. This paper uses
  rationale and technical details to support why this direction is beneficial. This original white
  paper also explains how Polkadot's core components work together to build this decentralized
  network.
- [Polkadot's overview paper](https://github.com/w3f/research/blob/master/docs/papers/OverviewPaper-V1.pdf)
  is an updated version of the white paper that describes the protocol in more technical terms. We
  would recommend reading this overview paper if you are interested in digging more into the
  protocol itself.
- [Polkadot's light paper](https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf) is a visual, easy to
  read, and less technical introduction into its blockchain technology. This paper dives into the
  components of Polkadot but is understandable for both a non-technical and technical reader.
- [Polkadot for Beginners: A non-technical guide to decentralization, blockchains & Polkadot](https://linktr.ee/polkadotbook) -
  a book funded by the Polkadot Treasury
- [Polkadot's specification](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-spec) is a GitHub repository that holds
  the latest Polkadot Host protocol specification, Polkadot's specification tests of the many
  components of the network, and the Polkadot Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and
  explores how various processes function in the Polkadot network. The Polkadot specification takes
  Polkadot's ideas and concepts from the light and the white paper but focuses on the technical
  specs of the technology.
- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNStMPZjiHM&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8):
  These are great introductory videos that explain and demonstrate how to use Polkadot and its
  [User Interface](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Reading
  [What is Polkadot? A Brief Introduction](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/what-is-polkadot-a-brief-introduction-ca3eac9ddca5)
  on Medium. There are also other great articles to read on
  [Polkadot's Medium](https://medium.com/polkadot-network) or
  [Web3 Foundation's Medium](https://medium.com/web3foundation).

For brand-new learners of Kusama, Polkadot's canary cousin network: To learn more about how to build
and maintain on the Kusama network, please head over to our
[Kusama Guide](https://guide.kusama.network/).
