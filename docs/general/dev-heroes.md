!!!info "Sign up"
    Use [this form](https://info.polkadot.network/polkadot-developer-heroes?ref=cms.polkadot.network) to
    sign up and become a candidate for the Polkadot Developer Heroes Program.

## Goal

Build a strong community of Polkadot developers of different levels of expertise to drive the growth
and evolution of the Polkadot ecosystem. Developers need to have some degree of experience with the
Polkadot technology stack.

The program provides:

- Opportunities for personal and professional growth.
- Resources and support to boost the growth and evolution of developers.
- Chance to showcase and enhance skills.
- Establish yourself as a valued contributor to the Polkadot ecosystem and pull someone else up on
  stage at the same time. Each one, teach one!

## Rookies and Heroes

A rookie is a beginner or first-timer developer. Someone who has previous experience in programming
but needs to gain in-depth knowledge about the Polkadot technology.

The technology includes but is not limited to independent [Substrate](../general/glossary.md#substrate)
chains and [ink! development](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/), and Polkadot-related tooling.
Rookies will need to learn these concepts and tools so that they can deliver the tasks required to
be a Hero.

A rookie becomes a hero by continuously advocating for the technology used in the Polkadot ecosystem
as well as spreading awareness and educating a broader audience about the technology.

Depending on what you enjoy doing, you can become a hero by doing some of the following things:

- **Offer mentoring**: Offer 1:1 or group mentoring to fellow community members.

- **Help out in the community forums**: Answer questions from the community on the
  [Substrate and Polkadot StackExchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/?ref=cms.polkadot.network)
  or on the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/?ref=cms.polkadot.network).

- **Contribute to the Polkadot stack**: Have a look at the
  [open source technology stack list](../build/build-open-source.md) and contribute with a pull
  request, an issue, or find and fix bugs.

- **Create content**: Write a blog post, record a video tutorial, and write a Twitter thread. Share
  about your latest coding success, something you learned and are excited about.

- **Speak at events**: Do a workshop or talk at meetups and conferences.
