# Project Dashboards

This page contains a list of dashboards about some of the interesting projects in the Polkadot
ecosystem. The dashboards are created using Dune Analytics and DuneSQL.

- [Polkadot and Kusama Decentralized Voices](https://dune.com/substrate/polkadot-and-kusama-decentralized-voices):
  The Web3 Foundation has introduced the Decentralized Voices program for Polkadot and Kusama to
  enhance involvement in OpenGov. By delegating 180,000 KSM and 42 million DOT in voting power, the
  program aims to empower active voters in these ecosystems.
- [JAM DUNA](https://dune.com/substrate/jam-duna): The JAM DUNA aims to be decentralized
  unincorporated non-profit association with a community originating in Kusama+Polkadot. The initial
  goal is set up the JAM DUNA as a Wyoming DUNA in July 2024. Wyoming DUNAs provide significant
  legal advantages over DAOs, requiring a minimum 100 members.
- [DED](https://dune.com/substrate/dotisded): DED is a memecoin project originated in the DOT
  community and developed by the DED Foundation
