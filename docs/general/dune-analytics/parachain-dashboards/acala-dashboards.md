# Acala Dashboards

## Overview

Acala is a decentralized finance hub and stablecoin platform powering cross-blockchain liquidity and
applications. It serves as a critical infrastructure layer for the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Featured Dashboards on Dune

Here you'll find a variety of dashboards that help visualize data from the Acala parachain:

- [Acala on Polkadot](https://dune.com/substrate/acala): This dashboard provides a comprehensive
  view of financial activities and token dynamics within the Acala network.

## Key Tables

Data from the Acala parachain is organized into several key tables: `acala.balances`,
`acala.blocks`, `acala.calls`, `acala.events`, `acala.extrinsics`, `acala.transfers`

## Useful Queries

Currently, there are no specific queries provided. Please check back later for updates.

## Getting Started with Queries

To get started with querying data from Unique, you are welcome to use the mentioned materialized
queries. You can use the following DuneSQL queries as examples:

```sql title="Acala List of Assets" showLineNumbers
WITH
    decimals_for_each_symbol AS (
            SELECT
                symbol,
                MAX(decimals) AS decimals
            FROM
                acala.transfers
            WHERE
                symbol IS NOT NULL
            GROUP BY
                symbol
        )
SELECT
    b.asset,
    b.symbol,
    d.decimals
FROM
    acala.balances b
LEFT JOIN decimals_for_each_symbol d ON b.symbol = d.symbol
GROUP BY
    b.asset,
    b.symbol,
    d.decimals
ORDER BY
    SUM(b.free + b.reserved + b.misc_frozen + b.frozen) DESC
```
