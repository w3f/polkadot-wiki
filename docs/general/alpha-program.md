Over 150 projects are using the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) to create
the next generation of blockchain infrastructure and application-specific chains.

The [Polkadot Alpha Program](https://polkadot.com/alpha-program) is an initiative by Parity
Technologies to take your Polkadot SDK-powered project to the next level.

Take your project from idea to market with comprehensive resources and collaborative development
while seizing the opportunity to shape the future of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Who can join the program?

The Polkadot Alpha Program is for teams with a project they want to take into production and
business execution. If your team is working on something that’s not yet live, and you are ready to
experiment while receiving and providing feedback, get involved now.

- **Parachain teams** - Focused on developing new chains or products within the Polkadot network,
  aiming to transition from prototypes to fully operational parachains and accessing coretime.

- **Infrastructure providers** - Dedicated to enhancing the ecosystem's underlying architecture,
  including node services, security solutions, API interfaces, and testing for robustness and
  integration.

- **Dapp teams** - Engaged in exploring and validating innovative blockchain concepts, leveraging
  the program's resources to refine and scale their ideas into viable projects.

## Why join the Polkadot Alpha Program?

The term "Alpha" comes from alpha testing, a form of pre-production testing and iteration of product
development. The program aims to enable your team to tap into Polkadot’s ecosystem of resources and
bring your product into production while contributing to feedback for Polkadot’s ecosystem.
