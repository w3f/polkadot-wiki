:::caution

Using your due diligence in researching and using the wallets listed below would be best. For any
issues related to these wallet, reach out to their support teams directly.

:::

If you are new to blockchain technology, generally a typical blockchain network account is a
public-private key pair. Access to a private key gives full access to all the allowed transactions
on that blockchain account. It is essential to keep the private key secure.

Typically, the account keys are either stored and accessed through a browser extension or a
smartphone app (which are considered as a hot wallets as they are online), or an air-gapped device
or a hardware wallet (which are considered as cold wallets as they are offline).

:::tip Not your keys, not your tokens!

With **custodial wallets** (like accounts in centralized exchanges), another party controls your
private keys. Private keys are used to access funds in your account, so you trust the exchange that
your key will always be given to you whenever you need it. With **non-custodial wallets**, only you
can access your account's private key.

:::

To realize the multichain vision of {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }},
it is important to have non-custodial wallets that make it convenient to interact with multiple
blockchains in {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem. Below there
is a list of all non-custodial treasury-funded wallets developed by the community.

## Overview

### Browser Extensions

At a bare minimum, browser extension wallets act as key storage and management solution, allowing
you to use your accounts with apps in the Web3 space. The wallets listed below offer functionality
beyond that, allowing the featured actions to be performed directly through the extension. Some of
them also allow interaction with air-gapped wallets and hardware devices.

### Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are fully packaged apps that allow all the featured actions, as well as the storage
and management of your accounts, through the mobile app. Unlike browser extensions, mobile wallets
usually canâ€™t connect to third-party web apps. Some mobile wallets provide support for hardware
wallets through Bluetooth connectivity.
