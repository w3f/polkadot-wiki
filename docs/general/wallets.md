Navigating the space of wallets can be overwhelming, if you are new to blockchain technology. In
general, an account on a typical blockchain network is a public-private key pair. Access to a
private key gives full access to all the allowed transactions on that blockchain account. It is
important to keep the private key secure.

:::tip Not your keys, not your tokens!

With custodial wallets (like accounts central exchanges), another party controls your private keys.
With non-custodial wallets, only you have access to your account's private key.

:::

To realize the multichain vision of Polkadot, it is important to have non-custodial wallets that
make it convenient to interact with multiple blockchains in Polkadot ecosystem.

## Non-Custodial Wallets

:::caution

You should use your own due diligence in researching and using the wallets listed below. For any
issues related to these wallet, reach out to their support teams directly.

:::

Typically, the account keys are either stored and accessed through a browser extension or a
smartphone app (which are considered as a hot wallets as they are exposed online) or an airgapped
device or a hardware wallet (which considered as a cold wallets as they are offline).

### Browser Extensions

Browser extension wallets at bare minimum act as key storage and management solution, allowing you
to use your accounts with apps in the Web3 space. The wallets listed below offer functionality
beyond that, allowing the featured actions to be performed directly through the extension. Some of
them also allow interaction with air-gapped wallets and hardware devices

### Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are fully packaged apps that allow all the featured actions, as well as the storage
and management of your accounts, through the mobile app. Contrary to browser extensions, mobile
wallets usually can't connect to third-party web apps. Some mobile wallets provide support for
hardware wallets through bluetooth connectivity.

## Supported Wallets

[Polkadot support](https://support.polkadot.network/) can provide assistance with issues related to
Polkadot-JS UI, the Polkadot-JS extension, or Parity Signer. For other wallet software, you should
contact the developers of that wallet. Please note that these wallets are oriented towards
developers and power users.

## Encryption Enhancement

Some newly generated `JSON` account files cannot be imported (restored) into older wallet software.
This is due to an enhanced encryption method, which is also noticeable in a slight delay when
encrypting/decrypting your wallet. If you are unable to load a `JSON` file, please ensure that you
are using the latest version of the wallet software. If you are still unable to load it, ensure that
the wallet software is using the latest version of the [Polkadot API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/).
