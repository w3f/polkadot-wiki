The Polkadot Ambassador Program is an initiative run by Web3 Foundation to support potential
contributors to the Polkadot community and ecosystem.

## How it works

If you are enthusiastic about [Polkadot and Web3](./web3-and-polkadot.md) and are willing to help
the community grow, you can join the program and receive funding for hosting events, gain access to
communication channels of core team members, and gain access to Polkadot events.

There are many ways you can get involved in expanding Polkadot’s ecosystem, such as:

- Contributing code and documentation related to the ecosystem
- Speaking about Polkadot at events, workshops, and meetups
- Writing blog posts
- Representing Polkadot in your region
- Mentoring and onboarding newcomers
- Identifying partnerships and opportunities for the Polkadot ecosystem
- Participating in calls and tasks that help drive the ecosystem forward
