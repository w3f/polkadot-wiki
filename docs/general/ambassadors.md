!!!info "Polkadot Ambassador On-chain Collective"
    Polkadot Ambassador Program is transitioning into an on-chain, rank-based, system collective after
    the approval of [Polkadot OpenGov referenda 487](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/487).

If you are enthusiastic about [Polkadot and Web3](web3-and-polkadot.md) and are willing to help
the community grow, you can join the program and receive funding for hosting events, gain access to
communication channels of core team members, and gain access to Polkadot events.

There are many ways you can get involved in expanding Polkadotâ€™s ecosystem, such as:

- Contributing code and documentation related to the ecosystem
- Speaking about Polkadot at events, workshops, and meetups
- Writing blog posts
- Representing Polkadot in your region
- Mentoring and onboarding newcomers
- Identifying partnerships and opportunities for the Polkadot ecosystem
- Participating in calls and tasks that help drive the ecosystem forward
