:::info Walk-Through Video Tutorial

See [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APxPsawebJw) and
[this article](https://blog.chainsafe.io/multix-a-simple-interface-to-manage-complex-multisigs-on-polkadot-97328be26f9d)
for more information about using [Multix](https://multix.chainsafe.io/) for multisig accounts.

:::

The [Multix tool](https://multix.chainsafe.io/) is an easy-to-use interface to manage complex
multisigs. The tool is part of
[the open-source Polkadot/Kusama Tech Stack](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source#user-interface).
Besides being user-friendly, Multix provides several benefits:

- When one person creates the multisig account, all the signatories see the multisig account on
  their interface.
- There is no need to pass around the call data to confirm a transaction. Such information is
  retrieved from the chain and displayed to the users.
- Thanks to the power of [pure proxies](../learn/learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy),
  adding and removing signatories or adjusting the threshold is now possible without creating new
  multisigs and Multix provides an intuitive interface to work with pure proxies.

The pure proxy setup used by [MultiX](https://github.com/ChainSafe/Multix) can be seen on the
[pure proxy page](../learn/learn-proxies-pure.md#scenario-three-multisig-controlling-a-pure-proxy).
