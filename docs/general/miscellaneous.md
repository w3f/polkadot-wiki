## Reconnecting the Dots

### Polkadot as a service provider

The current state of Polkadot can be compared to a modern day ISP (internet service providers), 
where Polkadot is essentially providing access, or specifically, local connectivitiy to web3. 

Polkadot would require another means (or another layer) of communication to directly connect and 
comunicate with chains that speak different languages.

### Polkadot as a management system

Polkadot manages a subset of the world's hardware resources, through its active validator set.
In principle, Polkadot is a management system which maintains its system through on-chain 
governance.

Polkadot's approach to management starts with sharding, which is essentially a dedicated CPU core.
