## Analysis of Polkadot

### Polkadot as a service provider

The current state of Polkadot can be compared to a modern-day ISP (internet service provider), 
where Polkadot is essentially providing access, or specifically, local connectivitiy to web3. 

Polkadot would require another means (or another layer) of communication to connect directly and 
communicate with chains that speak different languages.

### Polkadot as a management system

Polkadot manages a subset of the world's hardware resources through its active validator set.
In principle, Polkadot is a management system that maintains its system through on-chain 
governance.

Polkadot's approach to management starts with sharding, creating a set of parachain slots that 
serve as dedicated CPU cores.
