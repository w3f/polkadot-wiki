The Polkadot [research pages](https://w3f-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Publications.html) are
edited directly by the researchers at W3F and contain papers, articles and documents that are
sources for the information on the wiki.

The following papers and articles may be of special interest for those interested in exploring
Polkadot from a research or academic perspective.

## Research Papers

- [`Accountable Light Client Systems for PoS Blockchains`](https://github.com/w3f/apk-proofs/blob/9f3ed95d4dba4a4ea4b0dca3a57f4b7495271346/Light%20Client.pdf) -
  [`Implemented`](https://github.com/w3f/apk-proofs) as an efficient method to aggregate BLS
  signatures and BLS public keys which in turn is used to build light client systems that are the
  core cryptographic primitive for secure proof-of-stake blockchain bridges. In turn, the efficient
  BLS aggregation can be securely proven to a light client verifier using a custom designed SNARK.
