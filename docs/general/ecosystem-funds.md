The Polkadot has Ecosystem Development Funds aiming to support the development of parachains and
applications aiming to use the Polkadot Tech Stack.

The main funds include:

- [Scytale Digital](https://www.scytale.digital/)
- [Harbour Industrial Capital](https://www.harbourindustrial.com/)

## Scytale Digital

[The Polkadot Ecosystem Fund](https://www.scytale.digital/blog-posts/scytale-polkadot-ecosystem-fund)
by Scytale and the Web3 Foundation is a venture initiative focused on strategically investing in and
supporting projects within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. With over USD 75 million in assets
under management, Scytale has built a strong portfolio of over 20 projects spanning three
continents. The fund provides early-stage ventures with mentorship, liquidity, and access to a
network of strategic partners. Through its rigorous due diligence process, it selects only the most
promising projects. The fund’s value proposition includes offering technical advisory, KPI, and OKR
oversight, and fostering active ecosystem participation, ensuring sustainable growth for its
portfolio companies.

## Harbour Industrial Capital

[Harbour Industrial Capital (HIC)](https://www.harbourindustrial.com/) is a Polkadot-focused VC fund
managed by [Max Rebol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxrebol/) and
[Mario Altenburger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioaltenburger/). The fund launched in early 2022,
held its final closing at the end of 2023, and, as of 2024, reached an AUM of ~US$10m. LPs are
primarily family offices and institutional investors from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

With the [JAM upgrade](../learn/learn-jam-chain.md) on Polkadot expected to go live soon, HIC
launched a second fund in Q3 2024. This new HIC Fund II will have a target size of US$100m and is
expected to start operations in early 2025. LPs are primarily family offices and institutional
investors looking to build strategic partnerships in the Polkadot ecosystem.

HIC Fund II will pursue the main deployment strategies below.

### VC Strategy

- **Pre-Seed/Seed Round:** Some of the highest returns can be achieved by supporting great teams
  leveraging superior technology at an early stage. HIC has the best pipeline for deals and actively
  works with founders as they build out new products

- **Co-investments:** As a major investor in the Polkadot space, HIC is in a good position to lead
  rounds while inviting external VCs to co-invest. HIC also actively supports its portfolio
  companies in their follow-on rounds by introducing them to other investors

- **Strategic Investments:** Polkadot has best-in-class technology, and HIC actively brings
  established companies with a large user base to Polkadot. Integration into the network will
  accelerate their growth while also contributing to the growth of the Polkadot network itself

### Liquid Strategy

- **Validators and Staking:** As early VC investors in many Polkadot-based projects, HIC can help
  launch validators or collators for projects using our seed tokens. The fund won’t operate the
  physical hardware itself but delegate it to trusted operators with whom it shares revenue.

- **Liquidity Pools:** Holding both project tokens and DOT, HIC is in a good position to act as
  liquidity providers at Automated Market Makers (AMM). Resulting LP tokens will also be used in
  DeFi to maximize returns while actively monitoring leverage and risk levels.

- **[Coretime](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md) Brokerage:** HIC has been at the forefront of
  parachain auctions with Fund I. As the model of blockspace allocation transitions to core time,
  Fund II will run a brokerage model on coretime trading platforms. This is still a nascent market,
  so the strategy will start slowly and grow over time.
