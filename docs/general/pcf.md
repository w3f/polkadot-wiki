The Polkadot Community Foundation (PCF) is a foundation company incorporated in the Cayman Islands
whose activities are directed by DOT holders via
[Polkadot’s OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md).

The PCF serves as an optional off-chain vehicle for OpenGov to execute tasks such as signing
commercial contracts, making fiat payments, enforcing intellectual property, and contracting
third-party service providers like consultants. Unlike typical companies, the PCF has no
shareholders, members, trustees, or beneficiaries whose interests could conflict with those of the
token holders. You can read much more about the foundation in
[the original OpenGov proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/730) to establish it.

## Role of the Polkadot Community Foundation

The PCF serves as a real-world extension of the existing on-chain Polkadot governance process. It is
an unopinionated entity with no agenda, roadmap, or business purpose except to take actions directed
to it via OpenGov referenda.

In cases where token holders are interested in proposing treasury expenditures or other actions that
could benefit from either a real-world legal presence, off-chain accounts, accountable management,
and/or community ownership, they may author their proposals to include directions for the PCF to
fulfill these functions. The PCF’s functions are fulfilled by a 3rd party foundation administrator.

So long as the PCF receives sufficient detail, funding, and authority to carry out its directions,
the PCF administrators will do so within the confines of any legal, regulatory, and contractual
obligations.

## How can I utilize the Polkadot Community Foundation

To execute a proposal, the PCF needs clear detailed instructions to ensure it acts in the
community's best interest. Because not all OpenGov proposals involve the PCF, the PCF requires that
proposal authors adopt certain requirements to identify what is and is not intended for PCF action.

There are two types of Proposals: "Foundation Funding Proposals" and "Foundation Resolution
Proposals.”

### Foundation Funding Proposals

Foundation Funding Proposals are funding requests from the
[Polkadot treasury](../learn/learn-guides-treasury.md#creating-a-treasury-proposal), specifying the
amount in the preimage's value field according to the level of spend required, and setting the
beneficiary to the PCF multisig wallet address. The Proposal must also include the intended use of
funds in a comment on the [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov) website and begin
with “[Polkadot Community Foundation]” in its name. The referenda can use any
[OpenGov origin](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins.md) with sufficient spending permission.

Examples of Foundation Funding Proposals:

- Request funding for developing a Mobile App
- Request funding for growing the network's awareness through event attendance
- Request funding for a Polkadot branded clothing line
- Request funding for a Polkadot related advertisement campaign
- Request funding for developing a Web3 game on Polkadot utilizing a 3rd party game developer
- Request funding to diversify a portion of the Polkadot treasury into real world asset investments
- Propose funding to run a Polkadot branded competition

Ensure that the track selected aligns with the funding requested, according to the DOT amount
allocated per track.

#### Wallet addresses

DOT requested on the relay chain

```bash
13ECX4PUNHTdnpXX6KNeyd2qQHmruX6LE42iHuXcaBWVjz3e
```

USDT requested on Polkadot Asset Hub

```bash
167tDhLwaQ6kmqau1zwWx48Ux7CS1rxC9jW5kn8PeRZWAVUy
```

Please be aware that any proposals approved for funding by the foundation will require all
recipients of those funds to undergo the necessary Know Your Customer (KYC) and/or Know Your
Business (KYB) checks. This process may involve submitting personal information and supporting
documentation. Proposals that do not meet these requirements or fail to provide the necessary
documentation may be subject to rejection by the directors to avoid legal risk to the PCF and its
other activities.

### Foundation Resolution Proposals

Foundation Resolution Proposals indicate token holders' wishes for the foundation without requiring
funding. These must be of type
[system.remark](../learn/learn-guides-polkadot-opengov.md#submitting-a-preimage), with the remark
text starting with “[Polkadot Community Foundation]” and submitted using
[the Wish For Change submission track](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins.md#wish-for-change).

Examples of Foundation Resolution Proposals (Wish for Change)

- Propose a change to the foundations Bylaws
- Propose the foundation not utilize certain 3rd party service providers.
- Propose to remove/change a supervisor
- Propose to remove/change a director
- Propose the PCF transfer all or some of its assets to a charitable entity
- Propose to wind up the foundation

## How do I write a good funding proposal

When determining the amount of funding to request for the PCF to execute a proposal, the author must
consider the PCF’s costs to execute. If the instructions are perfectly clear and actionable, require
no further refinement, exploration, or discretion, and require minimal project management, then no
overhead is required. Otherwise, the PCF will engage consultants and 3rd party service providers for
specialized expertise or external support needed to fulfill its objectives, execute specific tasks,
or manage complex projects that exceed the capacity or knowledge of its internal team. As the PCF
sometimes incurs legal or operational costs to execute a proposal, we suggest including the greater
of 5% or $5,000 above the original funding request as a line item for PCF overhead to avoid any
unforeseen issues. The PCF will always carry out its directives as cost-efficiently as possible and
will return any unspent budget to the treasury, but in the event that a proposal has insufficient
funding, the PCF may be forced to request additional follow-on funding or in extreme cases, reject a
proposal for unviability.

When consultants or 3rd party service providers for specialized expertise or external support are
needed, there are three approaches a proposal author may consider:

1. Submitting a proposal with fully actionable implementation instructions for the PCF, with
   provisions for activities outside its remit.

2. Submitting a proposal directing the PCF to conduct a consulting or advisory project to create a
   feasibility study and implementation plan for an idea and share its findings. The community could
   review the findings and then a second proposal would be created to execute the project according
   to the suggested implementation plan.

3. Submitting a single proposal that combines both steps in the second approach, directing the PCF
   to conduct a consulting or advisory project to create an implementation plan, and then the
   discretion to proceed immediately into execution.

_For assistance in deciding the best option, the PCF team is happy to discuss and offer proposal
assessments to advise on sufficient budget, clarity, and structure._

Note that the roles of the PCF’s directors includes ensuring that The Foundation’s actions do not
create undue risk for the foundation or the Polkadot community. Following the approval of a proposal
via OpenGov, the directors can potentially reject it, if they determine that implementing it would
compromise their fiduciary duties, violate the foundation governing documents, the Polkadot
community governance process, or any applicable laws or regulations, cause harm to the PCF or breach
existing contracts. They can also reject proposals lacking sufficient detail, being too vague for
implementation or lacking sufficient funding. This is an action the PCF wants to avoid as much as
possible, therefore submitted proposals need to be as detailed and researched as possible to have a
greater chance of being approved.

## PCF FAQ

**Who can submit a proposal to the PCF?**

Any token holder who has a valid and actionable idea that aligns with the goals and vision of the
Polkadot ecosystem can submit a proposal.

**How do I ensure my proposal is appropriately funded?**

Provide a detailed budget breakdown in your proposal, including all anticipated costs. It’s crucial
to account for all phases of the project, potential contingencies, and any third-party costs, such
as contractor, consulting and legal fees.

**Where can I find referenda creation guidelines?**

This can be found on
[the Polkassembly docs website](https://docs.polkassembly.io/opengov/learn-about-referenda/creating-a-referendum/creating-a-referendum-on-polkassembly),
or [Polkadot-JS guides](../learn/learn-guides-polkadot-opengov.md#create-a-referenda-proposal).

**What happens if the proposal doesn't end up being sufficiently funded during the execution
phase?**

If additional funding is needed during the execution phase, you will need to submit a supplemental
funding request. This request will be evaluated similarly to your original proposal, and additional
funds will be allocated if approved.

**What happens to any funds remaining after a proposal has been executed?**

Any remaining funds after the successful completion of a project should be returned to the Polkadot
community treasury unless otherwise agreed upon in the initial proposal.

**Are there any specific requirements for proposals that involve third parties?**

Yes, any proposals that require the PCF to engage with third parties (contractors, etc.) must
include funding for contractor fees, onboarding processes, such as background checks and MSA
reviews.

**Where is the foundation incorporated?**

The Polkadot Community Foundation is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

**Are there any Cayman Islands-specific considerations I need to be aware of?**

Yes, proposals must comply with Cayman Islands laws and regulations. Activities that are prohibited
in the Cayman Islands, such as certain types of financial transactions or business practices, cannot
be funded or executed. Eg, Activities involving money laundering or gambling.

**Who are the signers on the PCF beneficiary multi-sig?**

The signers controlling these addresses are experienced, competent and well-known individuals within
the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Can I get feedback if my proposal is rejected?**

Yes, we provide feedback on rejected proposals to help you understand the reasons and improve future
submissions.

**Who can I contact for more information or assistance?**

For any questions or assistance, please contact the PCF team at info@polkadotcommunity.foundation

community, compromise their fiduciary duties, violate foundation governing documents, the Polkadot
community governance process, or any applicable laws or regulations, cause harm to the PCF, or
breach existing contracts. The foundation will not enact proposals that are too broad and require
discretion/opinion from the PCF.
