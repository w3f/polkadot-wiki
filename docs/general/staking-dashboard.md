:::info Native Ledger Support

The Polkadot Staking Dashboard has native [Ledger](./ledger.md) support, meaning that you do not
need an extension or a wallet to use it, just your Ledger device.

:::

The [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) is a tool that is
dedicated to [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md) on Polkadot,
[Kusama](../learn/learn-kusama-vs-polkadot.md) (Polkadot's canary network) and
[Westend](../maintain/maintain-networks.md#westend-test-network) (Polkadot's test network). The
dashboard is not a wallet, meaning that you cannot transfer funds between accounts. To fund accounts
you can use [third-party wallets](./wallets.md) or the [Polkadot-JS UI](./polkadotjs-ui.md).

You can participate to staking by being a [nominator](../learn/learn-nominator.md) or a
[nomination pool member](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md). For more information visit the
[staking page](../learn/learn-staking.md) and
[advanced staking page](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md).

## Overview

This section of the dashboard will give you the general view about current staking metrics and your
staking situation. These metrics include the **historical reward rate**, the **supply staked** and
**time remaining in the current era**.

- Balance Panel: The panel shows the bonded amount distinguishing between **nominating**, **in a
  pool**, and **not staking**. The amount that is not staking is further divided into **free**
  (balance that can be transferred) and **reserve** (balance that is needed the keep the account
  on-chain, see [existential deposit](../learn/learn-accounts.md#existential-deposit-and-reaping)).

- Recent Payouts Panel: The panel shows a bar chart with the rewards that have been paid out to you
  in the past 15 days either as a nominator or a pool member (manually claimed). Below the bar chart
  there is a line chart showing then 10-day moving average.

Additional statistics can be found at the bottom of the overview page.
