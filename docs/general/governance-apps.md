## Delegation Dashboard

The [Polkadot Delegation Dashboard](https://delegation.polkadot.network/) is a web3 application that
allows you to delegate your voting power on [Polkadot OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md).

!!!info "How to get added as a Delegate on the Dashboard?"
    Anyone interested in being listed as a delegate can add their details on the [Governance-UI repository](https://github.com/paritytech/governance-ui/blob/main/assets/data/polkadot/delegates.json).

To make OpenGov multi-role delegation easy and intuitive,
[Delegation Dashboard](https://delegation.polkadot.network/) provides an interactive interface that
displays the list of delegates and their details. The video tutorial below walks through the
features of the Delegation Dashboard and shows how to perform multi-role delegation.
