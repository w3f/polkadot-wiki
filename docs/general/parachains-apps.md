:::tip Polkadot dApps

Join the global Web3 movement – be among the first to try out innovative dapps running on Polkadot.
You can browse the list of dApps on
[the official Polkadot website](https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/dapps/). This page also features
a form that can be submitted to showcase dApps that are not already listed.

:::info Community Page

It is recommended to have the parachain apps added to
[the official Polkadot website](https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/dapps/) and then use this page to
elaborate their key features to the Pokadot Wiki readers. This page is open to contributions from
the community. Please follow the
[Wiki contribution guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-wiki#contributing-to-documentation)
and add your parachain app to this page.

## Astar Network

[Astar](https://astar.network/) is an interoperable smart contracts platform for Polkadot and
Ethereum ecosystems supporting both Wasm and EVM smart contracts. Astar provides native access to
Polkadot and Ethereum through its Polkadot parachain and Layer 2 scaling solution, while also
offering bridges into other major blockchain ecosystems.

Through the [dApp staking](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/dapp-staking/), Astar offers a
basic income to dApp developers, which allows them to continue building and enhancing their dApps
without a pressing need to apply for grant programs, issue tokens and fundraise to earn money. At
every block, a portion of the rewards goes to dApp staking and is then divided between operators
(developers) and nominators. As a dApp grows in popularity, more members of the community nominate
the dApp, and this, in turn, enables the developers who built the dApp to receive a greater
percentage of the block reward.

### Astar Portal

[Astar Portal](https://portal.astar.network/) is a one-stop-place for interaction with Astar
ecosystem, and an exclusive platform for Astar
[dApp staking](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/dapp-staking/) — users can
[nominate](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/dapp-staking/for-stakers/staking/) their
Astar/Shiden tokens on specific dApps they wish to support and get a portion of the rewards
distributed at every block. Portal also allows unbonding, rewards compounding and nomination
transfer.

Astar Portal supports Polkadot native accounts (Polkadot.js, Talisman, SubWallet, Clover, Math
Wallet, Hana Wallet, OneKey), Multisig accounts (PolkaSafe) and EVM accounts (MetaMask, Talisman,
SubWallet, Hana Wallet, OneKey).

### Astar dApps

Astar Network allows developers to use and build smart contracts in ways they never have before,
leading to the realization of truly innovative solutions that can't be replicated in any other
environment.

- [ArthSwap](https://app.arthswap.org/#/swap)

ArthSwap is a one-stop DeFi protocol that aspires to be the main DEX on the Astar Network. The

cross-chain DEX protocol based on Substrate, Zenlink DEX Protocol enables all parachains to build
DEX and achieve liquidity sharing in one click.

- [XY Finance](https://xy.finance/)

XY Finance is a cross-chain interoperability protocol aggregating DEXs & Bridges. Based on the data
from DeFi Llama, XY Finance is the top bridge protocol on Astar, opening gateways to users who have
yet to experience Astar’s ecosystem.

- [SiO2 Finance](https://www.sio2.finance/)

SiO2 Finance is the Multi-VM Lending Hub on Astar for Polkadot, that supports both EVM and WASM.
SiO2 Finance is the built of the community, by the community, for the community.

## Bifrost Finance

[Bifrost ](https://bifrost.finance/)is a dedicated liquid staking middle layer built on Substrate,
powered by Polkadot, providing non-custodial decentralized cross-chain liquid tokens for staked
assets. By leveraging Polkadot’s cross-consensus message format (XCM), Bifrost provides standardized
cross-chain liquid staking solutions for multiple chains currently Polkadot (vDOT), Kusama (vKSM),
Moonbeam (vGLMR), Moonriver (vMOVR) and other chains notably vASTR (Astar) and vFIL (Filecoin).

Through Bifrost Staking Liquidity Protocol
([SLP](https://bifrost-finance.medium.com/why-bifrost-slp-is-the-good-choice-for-decentralized-liquid-staking-ceb90091ef41)),
Bifost facilitates the issuance and deployment of liquid staked assets (“vTokens' '), allowing users
to earn staking rewards while retaining their governance rights and participating in DeFi, such as
liquidity provisioning on DEXs, providing collateral on lending/borrowing protocols and for
stablecoin issuance as well as restaking for securing decentralized solutions. Bifrost vTokens are
reward-bearing liquid staking tokens representing the users staked asset, including returns from
staking. As staking rewards are received, vTokens increase in value without changing the quantity of
tokens.

Bifrost aims to offer seamless staking and DeFi experience for Proof of Stake (PoS) users and enable
developers to build innovative applications around Bifrosts’ liquid staking tokens.

### Bifrost dApp

Bifrost recent development of
[SLPx](https://bifrost-finance.medium.com/slpx-pallet-a-further-step-into-the-omni-chain-liquid-staking-68cb4d99c82f),
is an extension pallet to Bifrost SLP that will allow users to invoke SLP's functionality on a
remote chain without crossing assets into the Bifrost chain, allowing users to mint, redeem, swap
vTokens remotely on the target chain. Leveraging this, developers can use and build innovative
solutions around chain abstraction and solving liquidity and user fragmentation challenges.

- [Omni LS](https://omni.ls/)

[Omni LS DApp](https://bifrost-finance.medium.com/omni-ls-dapp-the-easiest-fastest-and-most-secure-way-to-access-bifrost-liquid-staking-tokens-21ee080b03cd)
is a front-end application that supports remote minting and redemption of Bifrost liquid staking
tokens (LST) “vTokens”, as well as remote exchange, and swapping of vTokens from any chain. The DApp
aims to simplify the cross-chain experience by providing a seamless interface for users to interact
with vTokens across different chains natively.
