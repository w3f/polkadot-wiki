The Decentralized Voices program empowers broader community participation in
[Polkadot OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) by
[delegating](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#multirole-delegation) 42 Million DOT and 80,000 KSM
of voting power.

## Decentralized Votes

Building on the success of previous initiatives like
[the Decentralized Nodes Program](https://nodes.web3.foundation/) and
[the Decentralized Futures Program](./decentralized-futures.md), Web3 Foundation is working on
decentralizing governance within the Polkadot ecosystem to ensure a fair decision-making process. In
line with the Foundation's ethos, this program seeks to amplify the voices of passionate and
knowledgeable participants who may lack significant holdings, aiming to mitigate potential
marginalization. This initiative does not impact existing programs like Decentralize Nodes, as
[the tokens allocated can be used for both staking and governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#voluntary-locking-conviction-voting).

## How to Apply

Please fill out
[this application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIFOhMfoqRoeYqr1c_-UeB2a6u0YEsi9CaNEEeUAXtN0oE3w/viewform)
provided by Web3 Foundation. Information requested in the form includes the following:

- The account address to which you would like to have DOT or KSM delegated. This account must have a
  verified identity, including at least one of the following fields: X (formerly Twitter), Matrix
  (Element), or email.
- A link to a _publicly accessible_ declaration of your Polkadot “political philosophy” and/or
  agenda on the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/). This can include an actual
  philosophical statement, analogies to other political philosophies, opinions on previous Referenda
  or governance decisions, or any other way you would like to explain to people how you would vote
  in the future. This should be at least one paragraph.
- A description of why you would be a good choice for this program. This can include such
  information as previous votes (including votes with other accounts if you can prove you own them),
  as well as commentary, blog posts, etc. on Polkadot OpenGov or specific referenda. It can also
  include other information that you would consider relevant to decision making, e.g. being part of
  other political groups or legislative bodies.

The Decentralized Voices program initially designates delegates who will be receiving delegated
funds. In addition to the platforms mentioned above, to expand their reach, participants can
showcase their governance contributions and political philosophy through public declarations and
active engagement (optionally) on other social media platforms such as:

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/polkadot)
- [PolkaVerse](https://polkaverse.com/)

Delegations are subject to review, and non-compliance may result in revocation.

The Decentralized Voices program commenced on **February 6, 2024**, offering an opportunity for
dedicated community members to shape the future of the Polkadot ecosystem. For more detailed
information, see
