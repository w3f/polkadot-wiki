The Decentralized Voices program for {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
empowers broader community participation in [Polkadot OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md)
by delegating {{ polkadot: 42 Million DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 180,000 KSM :kusama }} of voting power. Interested
applicants can fill
[**this application form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIFOhMfoqRoeYqr1c_-UeB2a6u0YEsi9CaNEEeUAXtN0oE3w/viewform)
to qualify for receiving
[voting delegations](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#multirole-delegation) from the Web3
Foundation. For more detailed information, see
[the original Medium article](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-program-93623c27ae43).

Building on the success of previous initiatives like
[the Thousand Validators Program](./thousand-validators.md) and
[the Decentralized Futures Program](./decentralized-futures.md), Web3 Foundation is working on
decentralizing governance within the Polkadot ecosystem to ensure a fair
decision-making process. In line with the Foundation's ethos, this program seeks to amplify the voices of
passionate and knowledgeable participants who may lack significant
{{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }} holdings, aiming to mitigate potential
marginalization. This initiative does not impact existing programs like the Thousand Validators
Programme, as
[the tokens allocated can be used for both staking and governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#voluntary-locking-conviction-voting).

The Decentralized Voices program initially designates delegates who will be receiving delegated
funds. Participants are encouraged to showcase their governance contributions and political
philosophy through public declarations and active engagement on relevant platforms such as:

- [The Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/)
- [X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/polkadot)
- [Subsocial](https://polkaverse.com/)

Selection criteria include demonstrated participation in governance activities and ethical voting
practices. Delegations are subject to review, and non-compliance may result in revocation.

The Decentralized Voices program commenced on **February 6, 2024**, offering an opportunity for
dedicated community members to shape the future of the Polkadot ecosystem.
