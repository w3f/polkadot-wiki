These applications are useful for solo nominators and nomination pool admins.

### NOMI

[NOMI](https://apps.turboflakes.io/?app=nomi) is designed to actively involve Nominators in Native
Staking within the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} networks. It aims
to offer a unique and enhanced nomination experience, using
[Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-criteria_decision_analysis)
(MCDA) as a base for the analytical research. MCDA is an open and transparent approach for
evaluating numerous conflicting traits in the decision-making process. For the analysis, validator
data is collected at the last block of every session.
