The [Decentralized Futures Program](https://futures.web3.foundation/) supplemented the Grants
Program, and (as the name suggests) it helped strengthen the decentralization of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Overview

This program was set to distribute **20 million USD and 5 million DOT tokens** to support individuals
and teams as they launched new initiatives to grow the Polkadot ecosystem. The main objective was to
expand the network by adding self-sustaining participants. Funding was available for Polkadot-focused
organizations aimed to generate profit, and for non-profit ventures that had a strategy to secure
ongoing financing through Polkadot's on-chain treasury system beyond 2024.

The Program was run by the Web3 Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3
teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research, and collaboration.

## Program Goal

The goal of the Decentralized Futures Program was to kickstart economically independent, active
participants in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Applications

Applicants were encouraged to post the idea in the [**Polkadot forum**](https://forum.polkadot.network/) upfront.

Proposals had to be **submitted before July 1st, 2024**. Applications were **reviewed from Dec 1st, 2023 - Jul 31st, 2024** on a rolling basis.

## Selection Criteria

Several factors significantly enhanced the likelihood of application success:

- A well-thought-out and compelling plan outlining the project’s sustainability beyond 2024 was
  crucial. While injecting funds into the ecosystem is straightforward, convincing customers or the
  community of the value behind that financial investment poses a more substantial challenge.
- Applicants were encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of how the requested funds will be
  utilized, with granularity increasing proportionally with the amount sought. This meticulous
  approach ensured transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources.
- A demonstrated willingness to receive a more significant portion of the value in long-term DOT
  rather than immediate FIAT, aligning with the broader ecosystem's goals.
