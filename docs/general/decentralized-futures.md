The new [Decentralized Futures Program](https://futures.web3.foundation/) supplements the Grants
Program, and (as the name suggests) it strengthens the decentralization of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Overview

This program is set to distribute **20 million USD and 5 million DOT tokens** to support individuals
and teams as they launch new initiatives to grow the Polkadot ecosystem. The main objective is to
expand the network by adding self-sustaining participants. Funding is available for Polkadot-focused
organizations aim to generate profit and for non-profit ventures that have a strategy to secure
ongoing financing through Polkadot's on-chain treasury system beyond 2024.

The Program is run by the Web3 Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3
teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research, and collaboration.

## Program Goal

The goal of the Decentralized Futures Program is to kickstart economically independent, active
participants in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Applications

To apply for funding to the Decentralized Futures fill
[**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlPyHj56tY6t-5zhdn55VvznR5OACvXe8K1M6vRGmhdslZkw/viewform).
The form will guide you through each step of the application. You are also encouraged to post the
idea in the [**Polkadot forum**](https://forum.polkadot.network/) upfront. If you have any
questions, you can reach out to the
[**W3F Decentralized Futures Community on Element**](https://matrix.to/#/#df:web3.foundation).

Proposals have to be **submitted before July 1st, 2024**. Applications will be **reviewed from Dec
1st, 2023 - Jul 31st, 2024** on a rolling basis.

## Selection Criteria

In the current phase, we intentionally maintain openness in our approach. This deliberate choice
stems from recognizing that specific initiatives demand substantial and bold efforts, often
incurring significant costs, particularly in areas where traditional go-to-market functions are no
longer in play. Conversely, there are instances where individuals require relatively modest funding
in the tens of thousands to initiate their projects. This broad approach avoids constraining
people's creativity and allows for many possibilities. However, it does come with the drawback of
prolonged application processing times.

Several factors significantly enhance the likelihood of application success:

- A well-thought-out and compelling plan outlining the project’s sustainability beyond 2024 is
  crucial. While injecting funds into the ecosystem is straightforward, convincing customers or the
  community of the value behind that financial investment poses a more substantial challenge.
- Applicants are encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of how the requested funds will be
  utilized, with granularity increasing proportionally with the amount sought. This meticulous
  approach ensures transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources.
- A demonstrated willingness to receive a more significant portion of the value in long-term DOT
  rather than immediate FIAT, aligning with the broader ecosystem's goals.
