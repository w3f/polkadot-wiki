The new [Decentralized Futures Program](https://futures.web3.foundation/) supplements the Grants
Program, and (as the name suggests) it fits within the recent decentralization efforts around the
Polkadot ecosystem.

## Program Goal

The goal of the Decentralized Futures Program is to kickstart economically independent, active
participants in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Applications

To apply for funding to the Decentralized Futures fill
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlPyHj56tY6t-5zhdn55VvznR5OACvXe8K1M6vRGmhdslZkw/viewform).
The form will guide you through each step of the application. Proposals have to be **submitted
before July 1st, 2024**. Applications will be **reviewed from Dec 1st, 2023 - Jul 31st, 2024** on a
rolling basis.

## Selection Criteria

In the current phase, we intentionally maintain a level of openness in our approach. This deliberate
choice stems from the recognition that certain initiatives demand substantial and bold efforts,
often incurring significant costs, particularly in areas where traditional go-to-market functions
supported by Parity Technologies are no longer in play. Conversely, there are instances where
individuals require relatively modest funding in the tens of thousands to initiate their projects.
This broad approach serves to avoid constraining people's creativity and allows for a wide range of
possibilities. However, it does come with the drawback of prolonged application processing times.

Several factors significantly enhance the likelihood of application success: Firstly, a demonstrated
willingness to receive a larger portion of the value in long-term DOT rather than immediate FIAT,
aligning with the broader ecosystem's goals. Secondly, a well-thought-out and compelling plan
outlining the sustainability of the project beyond 2024 is crucial. While injecting funds into the
ecosystem is straightforward, convincing customers or the community of the value behind that
financial investment poses a more substantial challenge. Lastly, applicants are encouraged to
provide a detailed breakdown of how the requested funds will be utilized, with the level of
granularity increasing proportionally with the amount sought. This meticulous approach ensures
transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources.
