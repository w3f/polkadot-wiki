## Inflation

At the beginning of 2024, Polkadot's annual inflation rate was 10%. In November 2024, it was
adjusted to the rate of 8%, with plans for a gradual decrease over time. This change was proposed,
voted on, and executed on-chain by OpenGov Ref 1139.

Upon implementation, 8% of the total issuance equated to approximately 120M DOT per year (roughly
10M DOT per month) in inflation, with 15% allocated to the Polkadot treasury and 85% distributed to
stakers.

## Decentralized Voice (DV) Program Cohorts

The Web3 Foundation introduced the Decentralized Voice program in February 2024 to enable active
voters be significantly involved in the OpenGov.Each cohort is delegated 42M DOT of voting power
which is shared equally among each cohort's members. So far, there have been three Cohorts. The
current cohort 3 began in Novemeber and will run through into 2025.

## Polkadot Gaming+Defi - Year In Review

Here we summarize some key chains that led Polkadot Defi in 2024:

### Mythos

After completing migration to Polkadot in Summer from Ethereum, Mythos saw robust MAUs in Fall 2024
with 100K+ MAUs:

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/4517634/7545444" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

Over 450K DOT holders received Mythos in an airdrop via OpenGov Ref 643, see
[Mythos](https://dune.com/substrate/mythos).

### Hydration

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/3523775/5925828/" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

Helped by incentives from Polkadot, liquidity in the Omnipool started to grow massively in
Summer 2024.

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/3696950/6219927/" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

The account analysis shows steady growth and good retention, with predictable bouts of churn after
bursts of enthusiasm where prices jumped.

### Bifrost

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/3696915/6219857/" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

Bifrost's account analysis shows a peak of new customers in Spring 2024, with many not becoming
regular active users. If people stake and forget, this may not be an issue.

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/3571958/6012569/" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

Value staked peaked in March 2024, lost all of its gain for the year in 2024, only to rebound
strongly again in the last 6 weeks and again reach a peak of 90m at the height of the 100k BTC
frenzy.

GLMR staking moved elsewhere and MANTA was clearly #2 for 2024.

### Stellaswap

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/4093802/6892805/" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

Liquidity in the top pools on Stellaswap surged massively starting in September 2024, thanks to a
large grant of DOT to incentivize liquidity providers (LPs)

<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/3665704/6164782/" height="350" width="100%"></iframe>

Volume surged in March 2024 and November 2024 in line with heightened activity everywhere. Just a
handful of pairs dominate the volume.
