# Polkadot Dashboards Network

## Overview

This document demonstrated various Polkadot network dashboards, offering insights into shared
security, staking rates, validator dynamics, and staking pools. These dashboards aim to provide a
comprehensive understanding of the Polkadot ecosystem's economic and consensus mechanisms,
emphasizing network participation, security, and decentralization.

The **Polkadot - Shared Security of the Network** dashboard showcases the staking and validator
dynamics within the Polkadot network. It emphasizes various aspects of network security, such as
**staking rates**, **validator nomination pools**, and the **minimum and maximum stakes required for
validators**. This dashboard visualizes data trends over time, reflecting the network's stake
distribution and the participation of validators and nominators. It serves as an essential indicator
of network participation, security, and decentralization.

### Polkadot - Network Staking Rate Chart

This chart analyzes the Polkadot network's staking rate over time, focusing on the ratio of total
staked tokens to total issued tokens. It shows the portion of the network's capital used for
securing the blockchain, a key metric for assessing network engagement and security.

### Polkadot - Nominators & Validators & Pools Chart

The chart tracks the number of active validators, nominators, and staking pools. This data helps
visualize the network's decentralization and stakeholder participation, crucial for understanding
the robustness of Polkadot's staking ecosystem.

### Polkadot Minimum and Maximum Validator Stakes

This chart represents the stake distribution among validators in the Polkadot network on a monthly
basis. It illustrates the minimum, average, and maximum stakes held by validators, providing a clear
visualization of the variance and spread within the validator pool. Additionally, it highlights the
stake concentration by showing the difference between the highest and lowest stakes as a percentage
of the total stake, offering insights into the network's staking dynamics and the level of
decentralization.
