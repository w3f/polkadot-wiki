While Kusama has been its own network and has had its own ecosystem for a while now, it is still one
big experiment, and we need your participation for it to continue being a great success.

## Community

We want to foster a sense of collaboration amongst ourselves and the open-source community. Kusama
participants exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment
that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. We are here to collaborate, discuss,
and even disagree. The key is doing this in a manner that comes from a place of respect and
professionalism. Participants in the Kusama network may consist of an online forum, on-chain
governance participants, parachain deployment teams, validators, enthusiasts, and ecosystem tool
builders. We expect for there to be participation from all backgrounds but like to set some social
boundaries on how you may be treated and treat others.

Kusama community members come from across the globe and are not bordered by race, gender, or
background. Community participants have read through the requisite resources and obtained sufficient
knowledge about Kusama and all related content. This knowledge equips the community with the
requisite information needed to dispense of their duties as a participant.

:::note Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

These are just a few examples, and you can always consult a team member if you have any questions.

- Obnoxious, aggressive comments towards individuals or other projects on any medium of
  communication.
- Knowingly distributing false information about Kusama or other projects.
- Harassing other individuals or projects.

:::

That said, please note that Kusama is an edgy and meme-friendly network, and community member
actions shouldn't be taken too seriously - try to assume jest before malice.

:::tip What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns
relating to harassment, please contact the administrator of the channel you’re in.

This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time. We are always willing to revise this document based
on feedback from the Kusama participants and/or the Polkadot community.

## Bugs

Please understand that this network is, despite its success, an experiment with potential flaws, so
it’s appreciated that community members help report any sort of exploits directly to the team before
sharing publicly. Please see the [bug bounty program](kusama-bug-bounty.md).
