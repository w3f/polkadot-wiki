Over 150 projects are using [Substrate](https://substrate.io) to create the next generation of
blockchain infrastructure and application-specific chains.

The [Substrate Builders Program](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/) is an
initiative by Parity Technologies to take your [Substrate](https://substrate.io) project to the next
level.

Projects building Substrate-based blockchains, applications, or ecosystem components can receive
support for technical challenges, strategy, and ecosystem building from Parityâ€™s extensive
experience and resources.

:::info Square one initiative

The [Square One initiative](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/square-one/) is a step behind the
Substrate Builders Program as it helps early stage teams who are committed to build on
{{ polkadot: polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: kusama :kusama }} find their feet in the ecosystem.
Teams will navigate through the resources available in Substrate, and one of those resources is the
Substrate Builders Programme that will be accessible to teams once the are ready to leave Square
One. More information about the initiative can be be found on
[this blog post](https://www.parity.io/blog/introducing-square-one).

## Tracks

There are three tracks builders can take for the program.

### Chains track

This track supports builders who are building application-specific chains, which include parachains,
parathreads and independent chains too.

### Infrastructure track

This track supports builders who are building ecosystem-based infrastructure, which may in the form
of tooling, UI, middleware, bridges, and more.

### Application track

This track supports builders who are building on top of Substrate-based chains.

[Substrate Builders Program](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/) site for
more information and steps on how to apply.
