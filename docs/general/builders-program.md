The Substrate Builders Program is an initiative by Parity Technologies to take your Substrate
project to the next level.

Projects building Substrate-based blockchains, applications, or ecosystem components can receive
support for technical challenges, strategy, and ecosystem building from Parityâ€™s extensive
experience and resources.

:::info

Over 150 projects are using Substrate to create the next generation of blockchain infrastructure and
application-specific chains.

:::

## Tracks

There are three tracks builders can take for the program.

### Chains track

This track supports builders who are building application-specific chains, which include parachains,
parathreads and independent chains too.

### Infrastructure track

This track supports builders who are building ecosystem-based infrastructure, which may in the form
of tooling, UI, middleware, bridges, and more.

### Application track

This track supports builders who are building on top of Substrate-based chains.
