:::info Decentralized Futures Program

In addition to the listed grants programs, the Web3 Foundation is also currently distributing 20
million USD and 5 million DOT tokens to support individuals and teams as they launch new initiatives
aimed at growing the Polkadot ecosystem. For details, see the
[Decentralized Futures Program](./decentralized-futures.md).

## Web3 Foundation Grants

Web3 Foundation offers grants for open source software development and research around Substrate,
Polkadot, Kusama and ink!. Applications and deliveries are tracked transparently on GitHub.
Information regarding requirements, the application process, deliveries, etc. can be found in the
[Grants Program README](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#web3-foundation-grants-program). For
guidance, there is also a list of
[previously accepted applications](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/index.md)
and a list of
[frequently asked questions](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/faq.md).

### Polkadot Treasury

The Polkadot Treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing,
staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. Both
Polkadot and Kusama offer everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury. See:

- [Treasury Wiki](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md)
- [Polkadot Treasury Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZykdp2cyQavcRyZd_dgNj5DcgxgZR6kAqGdcNARu1w)
- [Kusama Treasury Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3UQUjph5t8TVaWnTkfrI5mE-BABnM9Xvtuhdlhl6JE)

:::info Kusama Faucet

Due to high demand and spamming issues, the Kusama faucet is no longer in operation. The Web3
Foundation has considered new ways to distribute KSM for people who need KSM to build.

If you are interested in obtaining KSM for building or research, you can apply through the
[Treasury](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md) or receive a
[tip](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md#treasury-tracks) for doing something cool in the
community.
