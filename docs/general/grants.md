!!!info "Decentralized Futures Program"
    In addition to the listed grants programs, the Web3 Foundation has launched the **Decentralized
    Futures** program to support individuals and teams as they launch new initiatives aimed at growing
    the Polkadot ecosystem. For details on the status of the program, see the
    [Decentralized Futures Program](decentralized-futures.md).

## Web3 Foundation Grants

Web3 Foundation offers grants for open source software development and research around Substrate,
Polkadot, Kusama and ink!. Applications and deliveries are tracked transparently on GitHub.
Information regarding requirements, the application process, deliveries, etc. can be found on the
[Grants Program website](https://grants.web3.foundation/). For guidance, there is also a list of
[previously accepted applications](https://grants.web3.foundation/applications) and a list of
[frequently asked questions](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/faq).

## Alternative Funding Sources

!!!info
    Check the [alternative funding sources](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/funding) section on the
    Web3 Foundation Grants website for comprehensive information.

### Polkadot Treasury

The Polkadot Treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees,
[slashing](../learn/learn-offenses.md), staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury
can be spent on spending proposals. Both Polkadot and Kusama offer everyone the opportunity to apply
for funding via the treasury. See:

- [Treasury Wiki](learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md)
- [Polkadot Treasury Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZykdp2cyQavcRyZd_dgNj5DcgxgZR6kAqGdcNARu1w)
- [Kusama Treasury Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3UQUjph5t8TVaWnTkfrI5mE-BABnM9Xvtuhdlhl6JE)

!!!info "Kusama Faucet"
    Due to high demand and spamming issues, the Kusama faucet is no longer in operation. The Web3 Foundation has considered new ways to distribute KSM for people who need KSM to build.
    
    If you are interested in obtaining KSM for building or research, you can apply through the [Treasury](learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md) or receive a [tip](learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md#treasury-tracks) for doing something cool in the community.
