:::info Need support with your Ledger Wallet?

If you need help using Ledger you can contact the
[**Polkadot Support Team**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/home).

:::

:::warning Please Note

Because of required WebUSB support, Ledger wallets currently only work on Chromium-based browsers
like Google Chrome.

:::

The {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)
application is compatible with the Ledger Nano S and the Ledger Nano X devices. Ledger devices are
hardware wallets that keep your secret key secured on a physical device that does not expose it to
your computer or the internet. The private keys will not be leaked even if you connect your nano via
USB to your computer. Ledger devices are also hierarchical deterministic wallets (HD wallets), that
is:

- _Deterministic_ means that only one seed phrase generates all the accounts for different
  blockchain networks.
- _Hierarchical_ means that the accounts are generated in a tree-like structure for different
  purposes.

Ledger devices can be equipped with applications that are blockchain-specific. Third parties usually
develop such applications, enabling the user to transact securely on the blockchain network. The
Polkadot Ledger application allows you to manage
{{ polkadot: Polkadot's :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama's :kusama }} native token,
{{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }}. It supports most of the transaction types of
the network, including batch transactions from the Utility pallet.

:::note Ledger apps may not support all the transactions

Check the
{{ polkadot: [Ledger Polkadot App](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot) :polkadot }}{{ kusama: [Ledger Kusama App](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-kusama) :kusama }}
specification for the list of transactions supported. Some transactions are supported only on a
specific app version, and others are not supported by any version. For instance, the staking `rebag`
extrinsic is supported on the **XL version** but not on the **lite version**. Also, joining a
[nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md) is only possible with the XL version.

:::

If you have trouble using Ledger or following the directions below, you can try searching for your
issue on the [Polkadot support pages](https://support.polkadot.network/).

## Requirements

:::info For Ledger Nano S users only

The lite version of the Polkadot Ledger App that you can install by default in the Ledger Nano S has
limited functionality. The Ledger Nano S is no longer produced and has limited memory that is just
right to accommodate the XL version of the Polkadot Ledger App, which gives the user more
functionalities.

If you do use a Nano S with the XL version you will not be able to:

- Install any other Ledger application on your device
- Add Polkadot accounts to the Ledger Live App, but you will be able to add them to
  [**treasury-funded wallets**](./wallets.md#community-wallets) who support ledger devices or to the
  [**browser extension**](./polkadotjs.md#polkadot-js-extension) and the
  [**Polkadot-JS UI**](./polkadotjs-ui.md).

:::

Here is a list of what you will need before using
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} with Ledger:

- A Ledger Nano X or Nano S plus (recommended for
  {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Ledger App space requirements and
  functionalities).
- The latest firmware of the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Ledger
  App installed (always check for updates in Ledger Live under the "Manager" tab, you will need to
  allow access with your nano).
- Ledger Live is installed and at version 2.1 or newer (see settings -> about to find out if you're
  up to date).
- A Chromium-based web browser is installed that you can use to access the
  [Polkadot-JS UI](https://www.ledger.com/).

## Using Ledger Live

Check
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000175822-how-to-use-polkadot-and-stake-with-ledger-live)
to learn how to use {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} with ledger live.

:::info

Ledger Live will only show the main account with BIP44 path 44'/354'/0'/0'/0'. This means that if
you import a [derived account using Polkadot-JS](#using-on-polkadot-js-apps) with a derivation path
44'/354'/0'/0'/1', it will not be displayed on the Ledger Live App. Consequently, it is not possible
to transact with derived accounts using the Ledger Live App, but it is possible to do so using
Polkadot-JS. Check [the accounts page](../learn/learn-accounts.md) for more information about
derived accounts and derivation paths.

:::

{{ kusama: Note that you cannot import Kusama Ledger accounts in Ledger Live. To see Kusama account balances, you must import your ledger account into a [**wallet**](./wallets.md). :kusama }}

## Using on Polkadot-JS Apps

### Loading Your Account

:::info

Ledger Live should be off while using Ledger with Polkadot-JS UI as it can interfere with normal
operation.

:::

You can import your Ledger account to [Polkadot Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) or to
the [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer). For instructions on how to import
Ledger accounts to the Polkadot Extension read through
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000175387-how-to-add-your-ledger-through-the-polkadot-extension),
while if you want to import Ledger accounts to the Polkadot-JS UI you can consult
[this other article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000170812-how-to-add-ledger-account-through-the-polkadot-js-ui).

#### Derivation paths

When adding a Ledger account using the extension or the UI, you will be asked to select an
`account type` and an `account index`. The first lets you select an account, while the second lets
you pick a derivation path from that account - think of it like a formula from which child accounts
are generated. When you are creating a
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ledger account for the first time on
Ledger Live with name {{ polkadot: `Polkadot 1` :polkadot }}{{ kusama: `Kusama 1` :kusama }}, this
can be added to Polkadot-JS using the 0/0 derivation path (i.e. account type = 0 and account index =
0). If you add a second account called
{{ polkadot: `Polkadot 2` :polkadot }}{{ kusama: `Kusama 2` :kusama }}, this will correspond to the
1/0 derivation path, and so on. We thus have multiple parent accounts that can be viewed and used in
both Ledger Live and Polkadot-JS. Additionally, we can use Polkadot-JS UI to create multiple
children accounts from each parent account. For example,
{{ polkadot: `Polkadot 1` :polkadot }}{{ kusama: `Kusama 1` :kusama }} with 0/0 derivation path can
have child 0/1, 0/2, etc. that can be used within the UI. However, such children accounts cannot be
used in Ledger Live, as it only scans through the parent accounts. So, remember that the balances on
the children accounts cannot be viewed, and you will not be able to transact with those accounts on
Ledger Live.

#### Connecting your ledger device

While using a ledger device to sign transactions, depending on your browser and its security
settings, you might need to confirm the USB connection through a popup like the one below:

![Display the device connection popup](../assets/ledger/query-device.png)

If you are adding your Ledger Nano for the first time, click on the "Unknown device" line and the
"Connect" button will become available.

:::info Signature error message

If you have already connected your device, but an error message appears before signing a
transaction, make sure you have opened the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} application on your Ledger Nano
device. Visit
[this support page](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181994) for
more information about signing transactions using your ledger.

### Confirming the Address on your Device

To display your {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ledger account
address on your Ledger Nano, you can follow the guidelines on
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181854-how-to-confirm-your-account-address-on-your-ledger-device).
Here you can scroll through and make sure the address matches what is displayed on
[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer).

### Checking the Balance of Your Account

There are a few methods to check the balance of your account. Check out
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000169332-where-can-i-see-the-balance-of-my-account-)
for information.

### Sending a Transfer

General instructions to send a transfer can be found on
[this support page](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000170304-how-to-send-transfer-funds-out-of-your-dot-account-on-the-polkadot-js-ui).
To sign transactions with your Ledger nano check
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181994).

### Receiving a Transfer

To receive a transfer on the accounts stored on your Ledger device, you must provide the sender
(i.e. the payer) with your address. To do so, follow the instructions on
[this support page](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181866-how-to-receive-dot-to-my-account-on-polkadot-js-ui).

:::warning

Before giving anyone your address, ensure it matches what's on the Ledger by
[confirming the address on your device](#confirming-the-address-on-your-device). Some malware will
intercept clicks and clipboard requests and can change your copied value in-flight, so being extra
vigilant around copy-paste operations makes sense.

:::

### Staking

For staking using Ledger devices, check the section "How to stake using your Ledger" on
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168057-how-do-i-stake-nominate-on-polkadot-).

### Removing Expired Democracy Locks

Check out
[this support page](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181870-how-to-remove-expired-democracy-locks)
the learn how to remove democracy locks after the end of a Governance referendum.

**Please be advised**: Despite the Polkadot ledger application being compatible with both the Ledger
Nano S and the Ledger Nano X, none of the [Democracy](../maintain/maintain-guides-democracy.md)
extrinsics are available in the light version. The following
[repository by Zondax](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot) lists the currently supported
Democracy extrinsics on the full ledger.

## Ledger Developer Release

:::warning

This section is for developers only. It is recommended to install the application from Ledger Live
unless you _know precisely what you're doing_.

:::

### Why you might need the Developer Release

Ledger apps for the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem are
developed by [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/). When new functionalities are added to the Ledger apps,
they are made available on a developer release for testing purposes. After a successful audit and
review, the apps would be available for download and installation using
[Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). As it takes some time for Ledger to audit and
review the release, the app upgrade option may not be available on Ledger Live when the new runtime
is deployed on the network. If this happens, users cannot use Ledger devices with the Polkadot-JS
UI, and while signing for a transaction, will most likely incur the error message "txn version not
supported". Please do not panic if this happens, as there are solutions to this problem. Suppose you
cannot wait a few days until the app passes the Ledger audit, you can install the developer release
from the shell using the latest version published on
[the Zondax GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot/releases).

### Install the Developer Release

:::info

See [**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/4SyVQrlXZ_Q) to learn how to install the developer
release of your ledger app.

Currently, the developer release can be installed only on the Nano S and S plus devices and can't be
installed on the Nano X.

:::

To install the developer version, make sure you have the latest `pip` version and follow the steps
below:

- Install _ledgerblue_ running the command `python3 -m pip install ledgerblue`.
- Download the developer release from the
  [Zondax GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot/releases). The file will be
  named `installer_nanos_plus.sh` or something similar, depending on your ledger device.
- Locate the downloaded shell script and make it executable in your shell by typing the command
  `chmod +x installer_nanos_plus.sh`.
- You can now use the `./installer_nanos_plus.sh --help` command to visualize the available options
  (see below)

![Dev Ledger Help Menu](../assets/ledger-help-menu.png)

- Attach your Ledger Nano (in this case Nano S Plus) to your computer, enter the PIN code, and run
  the command `./installer_nanos_plus.sh load`. Scroll with the right button until you see "Allow
  unsafe manager", left and right press to confirm. You will be asked to confirm the action of
  uninstalling the app and subsequently installing the newer version. After confirming both actions,
  the shell script will install the version on your device. You must insert the PIN code to use the
  device after the installation.
- If you wish to revert the version to the stable release, go to Ledger Live. The app will
  automatically detect the developer release and give the option to install the previous stable
  release.
