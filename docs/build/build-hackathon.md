## Join a Hackathon

Web3 Foundation regularly supports developer focused events! Be the first to know by signing up for
the
{{ polkadot: [Polkadot newsletter](https://info.polkadot.network/subscribe) :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: [Kusama newsletter](https://kusama.network/newsletter/) :kusama }}.

## Host a Hackathon

As one of our objectives in the Web3 Foundation is promoting the
[Web3 technology stack](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/polkadot_stack.md)
, we would like to support any individual or team who wants to organize a hackathon that gets more
developers to understand {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} and
Substrate in your city or online.

We are not only providing technical resources for you, but we can have someone from our team give a
hands-on workshop/presentation about the technology to help participants get started hacking on it
more quickly.

### Why you should host a hackathon?

- Connect with the Web3 Foundation team and larger community
- Support Web 3.0 education, opportunities, and more
- Learn the bleeding-edge technology
- Make lasting impact and gain connections in the community

## How do hackathons differ from workshops?

Hackathons (AKA Buildathons) are aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and
demonstrate their ideas to reality in a short period (few hours - one day), or online in a few
weeks. Workshops are more for getting developers familiar with the tooling and understanding more
about what are the resources currently available and how they can make use of it.

## How can you run a hackathon in your city?
