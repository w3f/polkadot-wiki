Welcome to the builder's section of the Polkadot Wiki.

Here, you will discover many development tools and resources in the Polkadot ecosystem.
We are always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about them so if you are working
on something that should be included please reach out to us on
[Element](https://matrix.to/#/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org)!

This section of the wiki is divided into the following parts:

## Development Guide

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/build/build-index.md
- [Starter's Guide](build-build-with-polkadot.md) - High level overview on choosing a parachain,
  parathread, or smart contract for your project and how to get started.
- [Parachain Development Kits](build-pdk.md) - PDKs are toolkits for building parachains and
  parathreads.
- [Smart Contracts](build-smart-contracts.md) - Smart contracts are fragments of custom logic that
  can be deployed to a live chain.
- [Polkadot Wallets](build-wallets.md) - Learn about the supported wallets and how to manage
  accounts.

  the Polkadot protocol, e.g. address formats.
- [Node Management](build-node-management.md) - A short overview of the Parity Polkadot client and
  the most relevant options/flags for infrastructure providers.
- [Node Interaction](build-node-interaction.md) - Learn how to interact with your node via RPC.
- [Transaction Construction and Signing](build-transaction-construction.md) - Learn the transaction
  format for Polkadot and how to construct and sign transactions offline.
