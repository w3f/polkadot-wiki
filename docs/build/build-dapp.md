As with any blockchain, building decentralized applications (dApps) is a huge part of how a
developer can build on Polkadot.

As an application developer, you can compose your front-end apps in a few different ways. Because
Polkadot and its parachains are all built using Substraste; you can often use the same SDK to
communicate with Polkadot, a parachain, or any other Substrate-based chain.

:::note Substrate-based chains use an SS58 encoding for their address formats.

Please see the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/) to see which
[chain corresponds to a given prefix](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json),
and which prefixes are available.

## SDKS & Libraries

If one aims to develop a **dApp** (Decentralized App), the Polkadot ecosystem contains various SDKs
to tap into the relay chain and parachains. There are several languages already supported -
[see the tooling page for a detailed overview of different SDKs and libraries that are available.](./build-tools-index.md)

## Frameworks & Toolkits

For front-end applications, several options exist for interfacing with Substrate-based chains
(parachains, relay chains, etc.) and smart contracts. These often will interact with the RPC of a
Substrate node:
