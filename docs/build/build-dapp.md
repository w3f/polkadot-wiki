As with any blockchain, building decentralized applications (dApps) is a huge part of how a
developer can build on Polkadot.

As an application developer, you can compose your front-end apps in a few different ways. Because
Polkadot and its parachains are all built using Substraste; you can often use the same SDK to
communicate with Polkadot, a parachain, or any other Substrate-based chain.

!!!note "Substrate-based chains use an SS58 encoding for their address formats."
    Please see the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/) to see which
    [chain corresponds to a given prefix](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json),
    and which prefixes are available.

## SDKS & Libraries

If one aims to develop a **dApp** (Decentralized App), the Polkadot ecosystem contains various SDKs
to tap into the relay chain and parachains. There are several languages already supported -
[see the tooling page for a detailed overview of different SDKs and libraries that are available.](build-tools-index.md)

## Frameworks & Toolkits

For front-end applications, several options exist for interfacing with Substrate-based chains
(parachains, relay chains, etc.) and smart contracts. These often will interact with the RPC of a
Substrate node:

=== "Polkadot.js"

    Promise and RxJS APIs around Polkadot and Substrate-based chains via RPC calls. It is dynamically
    generated based on what the Substrate runtime provides regarding metadata. Full documentation &
    examples available [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs).

=== "Polkadot-API"

    Polkadot-API will serve as a replacement for Polkadot JS. Full documentation & examples
    available [here](https://papi.how/).

=== "Reactive DOT"

    A reactive library for building Substrate front-ends. Full documentation & examples
    available [here](https://reactivedot.dev/).

=== "Subxt"

    Query and submit extrinsics (transactions) to a Substrate node via RPC using Rust. Also referred to
    as Rust Parity. Full documentation & examples
    available [here](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt).

=== "React Hooks for ink!"

    React hooks library for ink! smart contracts that abstract the functionality of Polkadot-JS. Full
    documentation & examples available [here](https://use.ink).

=== "ink!athon Boilerplate"

    ink!athon is a starter kit for full-stack dApp development with ink! smart contracts and a
    React-based frontend in one place. With convenient helper scripts and a pre-configured project
    setup, you can quickly scaffold any dApp. Live example & full documentation
    available [here](https://inkathon.xyz).

=== "Polkadot Cloud"

    Polkadot Cloud hosts a library of assets, ranging from data sources, graphical elements, to fully
    functional components, for app developers to plug and play into their codebases.
