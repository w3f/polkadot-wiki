The relay chain which is a layer 0 blockchain, does not support smart contracts natively. However,
parachains which are layer 1 blockchains are equipped with the functionality to support smart
contracts.

The two primary supported smart contract environments are [ink!](#ink) and EVM. There are multiple
[parachains that support both environments](#parachains).

## Difference between developing a smart contract and a parachain

### Layer of Abstraction

When you write a smart contract, you are creating the instructions that associate with and deploy on
a specific chain address.

In comparison, a runtime module on a parachain is the entire logic of a chain's state transitions
(what's called a state transition function).

Smart contracts must consciously implement upgradeability while parachains have the ability to swap
out their code entirely through a root command or via the governance pallet.

When you build a smart contract, it will eventually be deployed to a target chain with its own
environment. Parachains allow the developer to declare the environment of their own chain, even
allowing others to write smart contracts for it.

### Gas Fees

Smart contracts must find a way to limit their own execution, or else full nodes are vulnerable to
DOS attacks. An infinite loop in a smart contract, for example, could consume the computational
resources of an entire chain, preventing others from using it. The
[halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) shows that even with a powerful
enough language, it is impossible to know ahead of time whether or not a program will ever cease
execution. Some platforms, such as Bitcoin, get around this constraint by providing a very
restricted scripting language. Others, such as Ethereum, "charge" the smart contract "gas" for the
rights to execute their code. If a smart contract does get into a state where execution will never
halt, it eventually runs out of gas, ceases execution, and any state transition that the smart
contract would have made is rolled back.

Parachains can implement arbitrarily powerful programming languages and contain no gas notion for
their own native logic. This means that some functionality is easier to implement for the developer,
but some constructs, such as a loop without a terminating condition, should _never_ be implemented.
Leaving certain logic, such as complex loops that could run indefinitely, to a non-smart contract
layer, or even trying to eliminate it, will often be a wiser choice. Parachains try to be proactive,
while smart contract platforms are event-driven.

Relay chain and parachains typically use the _weight-fee model_ and not a _gas-metering model_.

## Building a Smart Contract

The relay chain does not natively support smart contracts. However, since the parachains that
connect to the relay chain can support arbitrary state transitions, they support smart contracts.

Substrate presently supports smart contracts out-of-the-box in several ways:

- The EVM pallet offered by [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier).
- The
  [Contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/contracts/)
  in the FRAME library for Wasm-based contracts.

### Frontier EVM Contracts

[Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) is the suite of tools that enables a Substrate
chain to run Ethereum contracts (EVM) natively with the same API/RPC interface, Ethereum exposes on
Substrate. Ethereum Addresses can also be mapped directly to and from Substrate's SS58 scheme from
existing accounts.

### Substrate Contracts

Substrate offers a built-in
[contract pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html);
parachains can also support [WebAssembly](../learn/learn-wasm.md) smart contracts. Additionally,
there is the [EVM Pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm#evm-module),
which allows a parachain to implement the Ethereum Virtual Machine, thereby supporting almost direct
ports of Ethereum contracts.

A video version of the recap of the smart contract situation is available on the
[Polkadot YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKHkFBXaUxQ).

#### Resources

[When should I build a Substrate runtime versus a Substrate smart contract](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56041305)?
This post answers the question more technically of when a developer might choose to develop a
runtime versus a smart contract.

Here is the list of current resources available to developers who want to get started writing smart
contracts to deploy on parachains based on Substrate.

- [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) - Parity's ink to write smart contracts.
- [Substrate ink! Workshop](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/) - Walks you
  through the basics of writing and deploying an ERC-20 token using `ink!`.

### Contracts Pallet

The experience of deploying to an EVM-based chain may be more familiar to developers that have
written smart contracts before. However, the Contracts pallet makes some notable improvements to the
design of the EVM:

1. **Wasm**. The Contracts pallet uses WebAssembly as its compilation target. Any language that
   compiles to Wasm can potentially be used to write smart contracts. Nevertheless, it is better to
   have a dedicated domain-specific language, and for that reason Parity offers the [ink!](#ink)
   language.

2. **Deposit**. Contracts must hold a deposit (named _ContractDeposit_ ) suitably large enough in
   order to justify their existence on-chain. A deployer needs to deposit this into the new contract
   on top of the _ExistentialDeposit_.
3. **Caching**. Contracts are cached by default and therefore means they only need to be deployed
   once and afterward be instantiated as many times as you want. This helps to keep the storage load
   on the chain down to the minimum. On top of this, when a contract is no longer being used and the
   _existential deposit_ is drained, the code will be erased from storage (known as reaping).

#### Storage Rent: Deprecated

`pallet_contracts` was initially designed to combat unbounded state growth by charging contracts for
the state they consume but has since been deprecated.

See the associated [pull request](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9669) for more
details.

### Polkadot Standards Proposals (PSPs)

Web3 Foundation supports proposals for Polkadot that define a set standards to fit ecosystem needs.
These standards go through several acceptance phases, where the engagement of the whole community is
needed to build valuable and future-proof standards. All the teams who will benefit from a standard
need to agree on its content.

Some of these PSPs are targeting Substrate's `contracts` pallet:

- [PSP22 - Fungible Token Standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/psp-22.md) Please
  visit [Polkadot Standards Proposals (PSPs) Github](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs) for more
  information.

### Ink

[ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) is a domain specific language for writing smart contracts
in Rust and compiles to Wasm code. As it states in its README, it is still in an experimental phase
so brave developers should be aware that they might have a bumpy - but workable - development
experience. There are some projects that have built projects in ink! with a decent level of
complexity such as Plasm's [Plasma contracts](https://github.com/staketechnologies/Plasm), so it is
mature enough to start building interesting things.

For interested developers, they can get started writing smart contracts using ink! by studying the
[examples](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples) that were already written. These
can be used as guideposts to writing more complex logic that will be deployable on smart contract
parachains.

ink! has laid much of the groundwork for a new smart contract stack that is based on a Wasm virtual
machine and compatible with Substrate chains.

#### Libraries for Smart Contracts in `ink!`
