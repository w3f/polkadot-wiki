Substrate-based chains, including the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, use an
[SS58 encoding](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/ss58/) for
their address formats. Please see the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/) 
to see which [chain corresponds to a given prefix](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json), and which prefixes are available.
