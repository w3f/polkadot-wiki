:::note Substrate-based chains use an SS58 encoding for their address formats.

Please see the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/) to see which
[chain corresponds to a given prefix](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json),
and which prefixes are available.
