[Rococo](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus#rococo-crown) is a Polkadot testnet built for testing
parachains. Unlike other testnets, Rococo allows parachains to interact with the [Relay Chain](../general/glossary.md##relay-chain)
rather than running in isolation. Rococo utilizes [Cumulus](build-cumulus.md) and HRMP (Horizontal Relay-routed Message
Passing), which is also known as [XCMP-lite](../learn/learn-crosschain.md##xcmp-lite-(hrmp)), in order to send transfers and messages
between parachains and the Relay Chain.

Messages are sent to the Relay Chain -> then from the Relay Chain to the desired parachain. Rococo
currently runs three test system parachains: Tick, Trick, and Track, as well as several externally developed
parachains.

## What Parachains are on Rococo Now?

You can view the list of included parachains on
[Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains),
and a list of
[proposed parachains](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/proposals).

## Obtaining ROC

ROC is the native testnet token on the Rococo testnet, and are available in the
[Rococo Faucet](https://app.element.io/#/room/#rococo-faucet:matrix.org) channel on Matrix.
To receive ROC tokens, send the following command on the channel:

```
!drip YOUR_ROCOCO_ADDRESS
```

## Build and Register a Rococo Parathread

[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus#rococo) is set of tools for writing Substrate-based
parachains.

If you are interested in running and launching your own parathread or parachain, Parity Technologies
has created a [cumulus parachain workshop](https://substrate.dev/cumulus-workshop/) to show you how.

Get stuck or need support along the way? Join the
[Rococo matrix chat channel](https://matrix.to/#/#rococo:matrix.parity.io) and connect with other
builders there.

## How to connect to a Parachain

If you would like to connect to a parachain via [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/),
you may do so by clicking on the network selection at the top-left hand corner of the navigation and
selecting any parachain of choice. For the purpose of these following examples, we will be using the
Rococo testnet "Custom Node" underneath "Development", following the
[parachain workshop](https://substrate.dev/cumulus-workshop/).

## How to make Cross Chain transfers

To send a transfer between parachains, navigate to "Accounts" > "Transfer". From here, you'll need
to select the parachain node that you are running. Next, enter in the amount that you'd like to send
to another parachain. Be sure to select the correct parachain you'd like to send an amount to. Once
you've hit the "Submit" button, you should see a green notification, indicating a successful
transfer.

### Downward Transfers

Downward transfers are when an account on the Relay Chain sends a transfer to their account on a
different parachain. This type of transfer uses a depository and mint model, meaning that when the
DOT leave the sender's account on the Relay Chain and are transferred into an account on a
parachain, the parachain mints a corresponding amount of tokens on the parachain.

For example, we can send tokens from Alice's account on the Relay Chain to her account on
parachain 200. To do so, we will need to head to the "Network" > "Parachains" tab and click on the
"Transfer to chain" button.

Notice here, that we can select which parachain to send the funds to, specify the amount to be sent,
and add any comments or a memo for the transfer.

### Upward Transfers

Upward transfers occur _from_ a parachain _to_ an account on the Relay Chain. To proceed with this
kind of transfer, we need to be connected to a parachain node on the network and be on the
"Network" > "Parachains" tab. Click on the "Transfer to chain" button.

Note that the toggle should be set to off, ensuring that the funds go to the Relay Chain and not
another parachain.

### Lateral Transfers

Lateral transfers are only possible with at least two different registered parachains. In true
XCMP, lateral transfers would allow for messages to be sent directly from one parachain to another.
However, this is not yet implemented, so the Relay Chain is helping us deliver messages for the time
being. Lateral transfers work through the depository model, which means that in order to transfer
tokens from chain 200 to chain 300, tokens must already be owned by chain 200 deposited on
chain 300. Lateral transfers are called HRMP, Horizontal Relay-Chain Message Passing.

Before we can actually send funds from one parachain to another, we must ensure that the chain's
account on the recipient chain has some funds in it. In this example, Alice will be sending some
funds from her account on parachain 200 to her account on parachain 300.

We can get that parachain account address, from our parachain 300's terminal:

```
2020-08-26 14:46:34 Parachain Account: 5Ec4AhNv5ArwGxtngtW8qcVgzpCAu8nokvnh6vhtvvFkJtpq
```

From Alice's account on the Relay Chain, she is able to send some amount to parachain 200's
depository.

Alice is now able to send from her account on parachain 200 to her account on parachain 300.
