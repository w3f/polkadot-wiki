### SCALE Codec

The SCALE (Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian) Codec is a lightweight, efficient, binary
serialization and deserialization codec.

It is designed for high-performance, copy-free encoding and decoding of data in resource-constrained
execution contexts, such as the Substrate runtime. It is not self-describing in any way and assumes
the decoding context has all type knowledge about the encoded data.

It is used in almost all communication to/from Substrate nodes, so implementations in different
languages exist:

- [Substrate Awesome](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/awesome-substrate#scale-codec)
  maintains a list of SCALE codex implementations.

## Data Crawling and Conversion

  extrinsics, blocks) for most parachains is readily available though public archive GraphQL
  endpoints, kept in
  [Squid Archive Registry](https://github.com/subsquid/archive-registry/blob/main/archives.json)
- [Polka-store](https://github.com/TheGoldenEye/polka-store) - A tool which scans a Substrate chain
  and stores balance-relevant transactions in an SQLite database.
