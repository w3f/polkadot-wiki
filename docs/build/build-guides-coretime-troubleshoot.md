This page aims to cover and aggregate various resources that relate to troubleshooting common
problems when using the Polkadot SDK or deploying on a core.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### Why do I have to sync Paseo locally? Can't I just use a remote, trusted node and connect to that?

**A:** You can remotely connect to Paseo network via the --relay-chain-rpc-urls flag, which can be
passed to your node. Unfortunately, the caveat is you can't use this node for collation at this
time - meaning if you intend on being a collator/validator for your blockchain and intend to create
blocks, you need to sync the chain locally.

### My collator is not producing blocks

**A:** Check these sanity checklists:

### I want to run more than one collator, how do I do that?

**A:** Ideally, you would want to run these on separate machines/servers, but you could as long as
you ensure you can provide different RPC/WebSocket and P2P ports for each collator. You also may
need to sync a separate instance of Paseo for each collator on the same machine. You also will need
to choose the block production mechanism like
[Aura](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/5572/production-like-parachain-setup-and-launch).

### Why do we only have one collator in the parachain guides on the Wiki? Isn't it better to have more?

**A:** Mostly for simplicity. If we have more than one collator, we would have to also spin it up,
which would be a hassle on a single machine (it is possible though). Of course, if you had an actual
network with multiple collators, it is assumed you'd have separate VPS/servers for each.

### Why are we registering parathreads and not parachains?

**A:** When registering a parachain on a relay chain, they are assigned a `ParaID`, and they are
referred to as Parathreads till they start producing blocks. _Parathreads_ are a bit of an outdated
term now. They refer to what are now known as on-demand parachains. Although they be references in
various places through PolkadotJS, docs, or other UIs, really we only have two types of parachain:
on-demand parachains, and parachains which use bulk coretime.
