While Polkadot itself is the mainnet, there are several networks that can cater to different
development or application-driven contexts.

## Polkadot Ecosystem Networks

- Mainnet: **Polkadot**
- Canary network: **Kusama**
  - [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) is a value-bearing canary network that gets features before
    Polkadot does. _Expect Chaos_.
- Official testnets:
  - **Westend** - Functionality equal to the current Polkadot mainnet, with possible next-generation
    testing of features from time to time that will eventually migrate onto Polkadot. Perma-testnet
    (is not reset back to genesis block).
  - **Paseo** - A community-run testnet which mirrors the Polkadot runtime. It is maintained by the
    community.
  - **Rococo** - Parachains and XCM testnet. Occasionally reset (started over again with a new
    genesis block).
  - **Contracts** - Wasm-based Smart Contract enabled parachain testnet on Rococo, primarily for
    [`ink!`](https://use.ink/) development.

{{ polkadot: Polkadot mainnet has been running since May 2020 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama mainnet has been
running since August 2019 :kusama }} and has [implementations in various programming languages](../learn/learn-implementations.md)
ranging from Rust to JavaScript. The leading implementation is built in Rust and uses the Substrate framework.

Tooling is rapidly evolving to interact with the network; there are many ways to get started!

But before you jump head-first into the code, you should consider the _kind_ of decentralized
application you want to make and understand the different paradigms available to developers who want
to build on {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}.

## Interfacing - PolkadotJS

PolkadotJS is the most widely used developer tool in the Polkadot ecosystem. It provides a web app
to interact with various parachains, nodes, and their RPCs, as well as a Javascript API for use
within front-end contexts. You can view more on PolkadotJS and its resources
[here](https://polkadot.js.org/).

For other programmatic ways of interacting with these networks (including PolkadotJS), please view
the [Node Interactions page](./build-node-interaction.md).

## Testnet Faucets

Almost all tesnets either have a web-based interface for getting test currency or a Matrix room
which you can post `!drip <ADDRESS>`
