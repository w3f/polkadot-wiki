Storage is an integral part of modern computer systems, and the same is true for distributed and
decentralized systems like a blockchain. When interacting with the Polkadot ecosystem, it will be
helpful if you familiarize yourself with the current Web3 approach towards decentralized storage.

## DCS (Decentralized Cloud Storage)

The key attribute that characterizes centralized cloud storage is the location of data.

In decentralized cloud storage, the key attribute becomes the data itself instead of the data's
location.

This can be viewed as the shift from the centralized _location-centric_ storage approach to the
decentralized _content-centric_ approach.

### IPFS (Interplanetary File System)

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all
computing devices with the same system of files, by utilizing features such as content-addressing,
content-signing, and enhanced security methods through encryption. IPFS aims to address the current
hurdles of the HTTP-based Internet.

#### Brief comparison of IPFS & HTTP:

| accessibility: data is distributed to multiple nodes and can be accessed at any time. Bandwidth is high: nearest peer can serve the data | accessibility: data can only be accessed if the server is live and there are no interruptions in transmission. Bandwidth is limited: clients send requests to the same server |

### Crust Storage

[Crust Network](https://crust.network) provides a Web3.0 decentralized storage network for the
Metaverse. It is designed to realize core values of decentralization, privacy, and assurance. Crust
supports multiple storage-layer protocols such as [IPFS](#ipfs-interplanetary-file-system), and
exposes instant accessible on-chain storage functions to users. Crust ºs technical stack is also
capable of supporting data manipulating and computing.

Crust provides a native cross-chain communication pallet based on
[XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm), called
[xStorage](https://github.com/crustio/crust/tree/parachain/shadow/crust-collator/pallets/xstorage).

The protocol also supports most smart contract platforms, including Ethereum, with its
[cross-chain dStorage solution](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildCrossChainSolution).

To learn more about Crust, check out the [Crust Network Wiki](https://wiki.crust.network/en). Try
integrating with Crust by following their
[Crust Storage 101](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/build101) guide.

#### Using Polkadot-JS Files (IPFS) module

Polkadot-JS UI includes a decentralized storage module that allows Substrate-based chain users to
upload their files to an [IPFS W3Auth Gateway](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSWeb3AuthGW)
and use the [IPFS W3Auth Pinning Service](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSW3AuthPin) to
pin their files on Crust Network.

Start by uploading a single file or folder:

![upload](../assets/files/substrate-files-1.png)

Choose a Gateway:

![gateway](../assets/files/substrate-files-2.png)

Sign the message:

![sign](../assets/files/substrate-files-3.png)

You should be able to view the file info, as follows:

![file info](../assets/files/substrate-files-4.png)

As well as the file status:

![file statue](../assets/files/substrate-files-5.png)

:::note

The whole files module is decentralized, so your file directory is only cached in browser. The file
directory info will not be visible if you switch to a new browser or clear the browser cache. The
storage module allows you to export file directory info from the current browser and import it to
the new browser.
