It's time to get started on the Kusama network! Please check out our recommended list for getting
started.

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to start familiarizing
  yourself with blockchain concepts such as cryptography and networks, and how these play into
  things like decentralization and cryptocurrency.

  This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and the course is free!

For brand-new learners of Kusama, check out:

- [Reading the Kusama Overview page][overview]
- [Reading the "What is Kusama"][medium] article on Medium.
- [Creating a Kusama Account][create-account]
- [Using Kusama endpoints][endpoints]
- [Claiming Kusama KSM tokens][tokens]
- [Running a Validator on Kusama][validator]
- [Staking as a Nominator on Kusama][nominator]

For brand-new learners of Kusama's cousin network, Polkadot, please head over to our [Polkadot
Wiki][polkadot wiki].

While Kusama does not support smart contracts natively, building apps on it is still possible
(example: [RMRK.app](https://rmrk.app)). If you're interested in diving deeper into _proper_
development, however, the [builders guide from Polkadot's wiki][polkadot-builders] applies to Kusama
as well.
