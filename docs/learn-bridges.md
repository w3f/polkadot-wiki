A cornerstone technology of blockchain interoperability is the blockchain bridge. Blockchain bridges
are ways for two economically sovereign and technologically diverse chains to communicate with each
other. Bridge designs come in a variety of flavors ranging from centralized and trusted to more
decentralized and trustless. Polkadot favors the latter bridge designs for its ecosystem, however
there is nothing that blocks a development team from building and deploying the former.

While bridge designs are now getting to a place where they are sufficiently planned out, there has
not been too many that have been used heavily in production. For this reason, you can consider this
page a work in progress. It will be updated as more information is determined and available.

## Bridging Methods

Building a bridge that is as decentralized and trustless as possible can be done through any of the
following methods (ordered by suggested methodology):

- _Bridge pallets_ - For Substrate-native chains, use a bridge pallet (e.g. Kusama `\<\>` Polkadot
  bridge, since both networks' parachains use Substrate).
- _Smart contracts_ - If the chain is not on Substrate, you should have smart contracts on the
  non-Substrate chain to bridge (e.g. Ethereum mainnet will have a bridge smart contract that
  initiates Eth transactions based on incoming XCMP messages).
- _Higher-order protocols_ - If your chain does not support smart contracts (e.g. Bitcoin), you
  should use [XClaim][xclaim] or similar protocols to bridge.

### via Bridge Pallets

Receiving messages on Polkadot from an external, non-parachain blockchain can be possible through a
Substrate pallet. The Substrate instance can then be deployed to Polkadot either as a system-level
parachain (native extension to the core Polkadot software) or as a community-operated parachain.

An example of a bridge that would strictly use bridge pallets would be a Kusama `\<\>` Polkadot
bridge, since both use parachains based on Substrate.

For the standalone chains that will not have a parachain bridging module on Polkadot
(non-Substrate), it will be necessary to deploy bridge contracts (see below).

### via Smart Contracts

Given the generality of blockchain platforms with Turing-complete smart contract languages, it is
possible to bridge Polkadot and any other smart contract capable blockchain (Ethereum, EOS, Tezos,
etc).

Those who are already familiar with Ethereum may know of the now archived [Parity Bridge][] and the
efforts being made to connect PoA sidechains to the Ethereum mainnet. The Parity bridge is a
combination of two smart contracts, one deployed on each chain, that allow for cross-chain transfers
of value. As an example of usage, the initial Parity Bridge proof of concept connects two Ethereum
chains, `main` and `side`. Ether deposited into the contract on `main` generates a balance
denominated in ERC-20 tokens on `side`. Conversely, ERC-20 tokens deposited back into the contract
on `side` can free up Ether on `main`.

### via Higher-Order Protocols

Higher-order protocols (like [XCLAIM][xclaim]) can be used to bridge, but should only be used when
other options are not available. XCLAIM, in particular, requires any swappable asset to be backed by
a collateral of higher value than the swappable assets, which adds additional overhead.

An example of a network that would be well-suited for higher-order protocols would be Bitcoin, since
it does not support smart-contracts and it's not based on Substrate.

## Examples

### Ethereum Bridge (Smart Contracts \<\> Polkadot)

As explained by Dr. Gavin Wood in a [blog post][eth bridging blog] from late 2019, there are three
ways that the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystem can be bridged to the Ethereum ecosystem.

1. Polkadot <-> Ethereum Public Bridge.
1. Substrate <-> Parity Ethereum (Openethereum) Bridge.
1. The Substrate EVM module.

Please read the blog article for fuller descriptions of each one of these options.

### Bitcoin Bridge (XCLAIM \<\> Substrate \<\> Polkadot)

The Interlay team has written a [specification][interlay] on a Bitcoin bridge that is based on the
[XCLAIM][] design paper. The protocol enables a two-way bridge between Polkadot and Bitcoin. It
allows holders of BTC to "teleport" their assets to Polkadot as PolkaBTC, and holders of PolkaBTC to
burn their assets for BTC on the Bitcoin chain.

The Bitcoin bridge as documented in the specification is composed of two logically different
components:

- The XCLAIM component that maintains all accounts that own PolkaBTC.
- The BTC-Relay that is responsible for verifying Bitcoin state when a new transaction is submitted.

For full details on how it works please refer to the specification.

There is now a
[reference implementation and testnet available](https://medium.com/interlay/polkabtc-beta-testnet-launch-2cc9ea7431b7).

## Additional Resources and Examples

### For Bridge Builders

If your team is interested in building a bridge between an external chain and Polkadot, there may be
funding available from the W3F [grants program][]. Please first check that the chain you are
intending to bridge between hasn't already been built or is in the process of being built by another
team. More popular chains with clear use cases will be given priority, and novel bridge designs are
welcome.
