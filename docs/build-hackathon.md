As one of our objectives at Web3 Foundation is promoting the [Web3 technology stack][], we would
like to support any individual or team who wants to organize a hackathon that encourages more
developers to understand Polkadot and Substrate in your region or online.

We are not only providing technical resources for you, but we can have someone from our team give a
hands-on workshop/presentation about the technology to help participants get started hacking on it
more quickly.

## Ideas

- NFT
- Bonded Tokens
- New governance pallets with different styles of voting & democracy
- Upgrade the TCR pallet
- IPFS integration
- Decentralized identity solutions
- Oracle pallet
- Implement Generalized State Channel/Plasma Chain
- Decentralized Exchange
- Tools for monitoring validator performance
- dApps across different parachains

## Why you should host a hackathon?

- Love to deliver the vision of Web3
- Learn the bleeding-edge technology
- Believe the Web3 technology stack is suitable for developers to build their applications
- Like to make connections

## How do hackathons differ from workshops?

A hackathon is aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and demonstrate their ideas
to reality in a short period (few hours - one day). Workshops are aimed at familiarizing developers
with the underlying knowledge and tooling about the resources currently available for certain
technologies and how they can make use of it.

## How can you run a hackathon in your city?

1. Submit your application (Coming soon.)
2. Review
3. Decision
4. Follow up

## How we can help

- Provide technical resources/materials.
- Find a venue.
- Ensure the hackathon runs smoothly.

## Past Hackathons

- [Hackusama](https://hackusama.devpost.com/) - A 7-week online hackathon that was launched for
  developers to "Build a Blockchain" or submit their wildest tools, visualizations, and ideas to the
  "Open Hack" category. Many high quality submissions were received.
- [Hello World! by Polkadot](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/polkadot/onboard) - A collaborative
