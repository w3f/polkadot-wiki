## Create a Referenda Proposal using Polkadot-JS UI

### Submitting a Preimage

The act of making a proposal is split from submitting the preimage for the proposal since the
storage cost of submitting a large preimage could be pretty expensive. Allowing for the preimage
submission to come as a separate transaction means that another account could submit the preimage
for you and pay the fee for it. The example below demonstrates the creation of a preimage on Kusama
(**the same procedure applies when OpenGov is live on Polkadot**). To propose that a remark "Expect
Chaos!" be added to the blockchain, the preimage hash would be
`0x8ac3f722caf7677254e25ca4ad77d533ca893c7d2ad4009e258d749f2004ef94`.

After the preimage is submitted successfuly on-chain, Polkadot-JS UI lists it under the tab of
Governance > Preimages.

### Submitting a Proposal

Submitting a proposal requires you to bond some tokens. On Polkadot-JS UI, you can navigate to the
Governance -> Referenda to make a new proposal. In order to submit a proposal, you will need to
submit what's called the preimage hash. The preimage hash is simply the hash of the proposal to be
enacted. The easiest way to get the preimage hash is by clicking on the "Submit preimage" button as
shown in the previous section.

![submit proposal](../assets/governance/opengov-submit-proposal.png)

The proposal will be registered from the account selected and the balance lock will be applied to
it. An appropriate origin must be chosen, as each origin has different privileges, and acceptance
criteria. After entering the hash of the preimage for the proposal, the preimage length field is
automatically populated. The enactment delay can be specified either as a block number, or as a
specific number of blocks after the referendum is approved. The deposit for this proposal will be
locked for the referendum duration.

## Voting on Referenda

To vote on a referendum, navigate to the "Referenda" tab of Polkadot-JS UI. All the active referenda
will be shown in their respective track sections. Click the "Vote" button to cast a vote for the
corresponding referendum. As OpenGov takes both the approval and support into account, there are
four options to choose from when voting on a referendum:

- Aye
- Nay
- Split
- Abstain

Also, you have to specify the conviction multiplier for this vote. The longer you are willing to
lock your tokens, the stronger your vote will be weighted. Unwillingness to lock your tokens means
that your vote only counts for 10% of the tokens that you hold.

:::caution OpenGov uses Conviction Voting Pallet (Not Democracy Pallet)

Use `convictionVoting.vote` for voting on Referenda in OpenGov instead of `democracy.vote` (which
only works for old version of governance).

:::

### Removing expired voting locks

To remove the lock from votes you first need to call `removeVote` and then `unlock` through the
`convictionVoting` pallet.

## Origins and Tracks

<!-- Show only Kusama as OpenGov is not yet available on Polkadot -->
<Tracks network="kusama" defaultValue="Loading Kusama Tracks..."/>

<!-- When OpenGov moves to Polkadot replace the above content with these condition statements -->
<!-- {{ polkadot: <Tracks network="polkadot" defaultValue="Loading Polkadot Tracks..."/> :polkadot }} -->
<!-- {{ kusama: <Tracks network="kusama" defaultValue="Loading Kusama Tracks..."/> :kusama }} -->

## Delegating Voting Power

For an overview on how delegation works in OpenGov, check out the
[Multirole Delegation](./../learn/learn-opengov.md#multirole-delegation) section on the
[Learn OpenGov](./../learn/learn-opengov.md) page.

The following steps outline how to delegate voting power in OpenGov:

1. Navigate to the [referenda tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/referenda)
2. Click the `Delegate` icon in the top-right corner
   ![Delegate Window](./../assets/governance/Delegate-Window-Kusama.png)
3. Ensure the `delegate from account` field lists the account you wish to apply delegation over
4. Next, select the appropriate `submission track` that you wish to delegate (or select the option
   `apply delegation to all tracks`)
5. Specify the `delegate vote value`, which is the amount of DOT or KSM you wish to provide the
   delegate with
6. Provide a `conviction` multiplier determining how long the funds from the previous step are locked
   (for additional details see the section on [Voluntary Locking](#voluntary-locking)) and click
   `Next`
7. The final step is to provide the account address that will be the delegate for the original
   account provided (this account will be receiving the voting power for the source account on
   the specified track)

![Delegate](./../assets/governance/Delegate-Kusama.png)

When you are ready to undelegate:

1. Navigate to the [extrinsics tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics)
2. Select a wallet address that is currently delegating to another account
3. From the `submit the following extrinsic` dropdown, select `convictionVoting`
4. Select `undelegate` from the next dropdown to the right of the previous step (note you can also
   delegate from this page as an alternative to the solution provided above)
5. Provide the `submission track` that was used when originally delegating from above
6. Sign and submit the transaction to restore the voting power back to the original source address
