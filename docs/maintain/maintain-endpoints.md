Ideally, one may run their own node when interacting with the
[Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network/) via [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/)
or other UIs and programmatic methods. Another option would be to connect to one of the several
public endpoints provided by infrastructure and API service providers. For development convenience,
[Parity Tech](https://www.parity.io/) maintains archive nodes for Polkadot, Kusama, and their test
networks with public endpoints. These endpoints can be used with
[Polkadot-JS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api) to interact with their respective chains. The
tables below list these endpoints.

### Network Endpoints

Endpoints for all production and test networks are listed on the
[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) which are accessed from
[here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/master/packages/apps-config/src/endpoints).
Endpoints for Polkadot relay chain and Kusama relay chain, parachains, and Paseo test network are
maintained by the community. System Chains as well as Westend test network endpoints maintained by
Parity Technologies are listed below:

#### Example usage with Polkadot-JS API

To connect to the Parity node for the Polkadot Asset Hub, use the endpoint in your JavaScript apps
like so:

```javascript {5}
// Using the Polkadot Mainnet Endpoint
const { ApiPromise, WsProvider } = require('@polkadot/api');
async () => {
  // Construct a provider with the endpoint URL
  const provider = new WsProvider('wss://polkadot-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io');
  // Create an API instance for Polkadot
  const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider });
  // ...
```

### Third Party Providers

There are a number of third-party providers of RPC infrastructure to the Polkadot and Kusama
communities, commonly providing access to multiple networks and parachains in a single service. They
provide additional services such as higher rate limits, potentially more reliable and scalable
service, and additional metrics.
