## Best practices to prevent slashing

Slashing is implemented as a deterrent for validators to misbehave. Slashes are applied to a
validator’s total stake (own + nominated) and can range from as little as 0.01% or rise to 100%. In
all instances, slashes are accompanied by a loss of nominators.

A slash may occur under four circumstances:

1.  Equivocation – A slash of 0.01% is applied with as little as a single evocation. The slashed
    amount increases to 100% incrementally as more validators also equivocate.
2.  Malicious action – This may result from a validator trying to represent the contents of a block
    falsely. Slashing penalties of 100% may apply.
3.  Application related (bug or otherwise) – The amount is unknown and may manifest as scenarios 1
    and 2 above.

This article provides some best practices to prevent slashing based on lessons learned from previous
slashes. It provides comments and guidance for all circumstances except for malicious action by the
node operator.

## Equivocation

Equivocation events can occur when a validator produces two or more of the same block; under this
condition, it is referred to as a BABE equivocation. Equivocation may also happen when a validator
signs two or more of the same consensus vote; under this condition, it is referred to as a GRANDPA
Equivocation. Equivocations usually occur when duplicate signing keys reside on the validator host.
If keys are never duplicated, the probability of an equivocation slash decreases to near 0. Check
the Wiki section on [Equivocation](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#equivocation) to learn more
about its specifics.

The following are scenarios that build towards slashes under equivocation:

1.  Cloning a server, i.e., copying all contents when migrating to new hardware. This action should
    be avoided. If an image is desired, it should be taken before keys are generated.
2.  High Availability (HA) Systems – Equivocation can occur if there are any concurrent operations,
    either when a failed server restarts or if false positive event results in both servers being
    online simultaneously. HA systems are to be treated with extreme caution and are not advised.
3.  The keystore folder is copied when attempting to copy a database from one instance to another.  
    It is important to note that equivocation slashes occur with a single incident. This can happen
    if duplicated keystores are used for only a few seconds. A slash can result in losing
    nominators, and funds, removal from the Thousand Validator Programme, and reputational damage.

## Application Related

In the past, there have been releases with bugs that lead to slashes; these issues are not as
prevalent in current releases. The following are advised to node operators to ensure that they
obtain pristine binaries or source code and to ensure the security of their node:

1.  Always download either source files or binaries from the official Parity repository
2.  Verify the hash of downloaded files.
3.  Use the W3F secure validator setup or adhere to its principles
4.  Ensure essential security items are checked, use a firewall, manage user access, use SSH
    certificates
5.  Avoid using your server as a general-purpose system. Hosting a validator on your workstation or
    one that hosts other services increases the risk of maleficence.

The on-chain event can be viewed [here](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/11190109-0?event=11190109-5). | The validator did not submit a request for the slash to be canceled.                                                               |
| Kusama   | 3329 | Small Equivocation | The validator operated a test machine with cloned keys; the test machine was online at the same time as the primary, which resulted in a slash. Details can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1343).                                                                                                        | The validator requested a cancellation of the slash, but the council declined.                                                     |
| Kusama   | 3995 | Small Equivocation | The validator noticed several errors, after which the client crashed, and a slash was applied. The validator recorded all events and opened GitHub issues to allow for technical opinions to be shared. Details can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1733).                                                | The validator requested to cancel the slash. The council approved the request as they believed the error was not operator related. |
