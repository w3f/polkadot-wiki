:::info Who is this guide for?

This guide is relevant for cumulus based parachain projects started in 2023 or before. Later
projects should already be async backing compatible. If starting a new parachain project, please use
an async backing compatible template such as
[`cumulus/parachain-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/rh-test-async-backing).
