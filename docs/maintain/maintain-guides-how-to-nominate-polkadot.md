Nominators are one type of participant in the staking subsystem of
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}. They appoint their stake to the
validators, the second type of participant. By appointing their stake, they can elect the active set
of validators and share in the rewards that are paid out.

While the [validators](maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot.md) are active participants in the
network that engage in the block production and finality mechanisms, nominators take a slightly more
passive role. Being a nominator does not require running a node of your own or worrying about online
uptime. However, a good nominator performs due diligence on the validators that they elect. When
looking for validators to nominate, a nominator should pay attention to their own reward percentage
for nominating a specific validator - as well as the risk that they bear of being slashed if the
validator gets slashed.
