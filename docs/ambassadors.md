The Polkadot Ambassador Programme is an initiative run by Web3 Foundation to support contributors to
the Polkadot community and ecosystem (Ambassadors).

## How it works

If you are enthusiastic about Polkadot and Web3 and are willing to help the community grow you can
join the program and receive funding for hosting events, access to communication channels of core
team members, and expanded access to Polkadot events.

There are many ways you can be involved in expanding Polkadot’s ecosystem, for example by:

- Contributing code and documentation related to the ecosystem
- Speaking about Polkadot at events, workshops, and meetups
- Writing blog posts
- Representing your region on Polkadot projects
- Mentoring newcomers to the platform
- Identifying partnerships and opportunities for Polkadot
- Participating in calls and tasks that help drive the ecosystem forward
