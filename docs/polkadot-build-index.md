_Polkadot is under construction, these documents will likely change._

Welcome to the builders section of the Polkadot wiki.

Here you will be able to find the most up-to-date information on the status of the development tools in the @(Polkadot) ecosystem.
We are always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about them so if you are working on something that should be included please reach out to us on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org).

This section of the wiki is divided into three parts: the first
part takes the shape of a technical guide that will get you quickly
up to speed with developing for Polkadot. The second part is an
up-to-date catalogue of developer tooling. The third part is a
resource which will contain some deeper technical information
that is not available to be found elsewhere.
